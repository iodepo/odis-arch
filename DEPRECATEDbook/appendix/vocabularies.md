# Controlled Vocabularies

## About

See also:  [ODIS-ARCH Vocabularies](https://github.com/iodepo/odis-arch/blob/master/docs/vocabularies.md)

A list of possible controlled vocabularies to use in the schema.org documents.
Many such resources can be found by searching at [BARTOC.org](https://bartoc.org/)
or the [UNESCO Thesaurus](http://vocabularies.unesco.org/browser/thesaurus/en/).

Note, at present this is an exploration and there is not yet a recommendation
for use in OIH.
