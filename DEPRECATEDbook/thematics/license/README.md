# Licenses


## Schema.org License

- https://schema.org/license
    - `URL`
    - `CreativeWork`

### License as URL - Good

<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"</strong>
}
</pre>

### License as CreativeWork - Better?

<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"license": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0",
    "url": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  }</strong>
}
</pre>

### License as SPDX URL - Best

- Use a simple URL
- [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) creates URLs for many licenses including those that don't have URLs
- From a source that <em>harvesters</em> can rely on (e.g. use URL to lookup more information about the license)

<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"license": "https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0"</strong>
}
</pre>

OR, include both the SPDX and the Creative Commons URLs in an array:

<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"license": ["https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"]</strong>
}
</pre>
