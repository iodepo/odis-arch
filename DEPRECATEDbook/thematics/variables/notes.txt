# Notes

* Move the geospatial geometry to under Coverage -> Place
* Make a Core 0 as Dataset
* note license pattern  (make this a support patterm 8 entry)
* think next about Products and Services in the schema.org OIH approach
* need to make a page about "context" from the OIH point of view
* need a future document about Methods and Event  (think about the instrument element here too)

* how to define a "cross archive" action
* Need PROV for "Person" as export, connect Person to the group publishing the info as MemberOf
* SOSO reference for time interval:  https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#geologic-time 

This is the start of the EOV and related variables section.  At present this is just notes.

To comment on the graph:
* Each EOV dataset MUST have the following components to be considered complete:
* A qualified link to the DOI of the method used to generate that dataset
* A qualified link to a DOI of the QA/QC processes and principles used on that dataset
* A qualified link to to the GOOS EOV specification sheet the EOV is supposed to align to
* A qualified link/element that points to the variables/elements in that dataset that is the EOV (if it's a complex dataset)
  * That element should have a propertyID to an ontology term (from an ontology that can be interpreted by GOOS/IODE) that identifies which EOV it is
* A qualified link to the measurement event(s)
  * that can link onward to the measurement devices used
* A qualified link to the spatial coverage of the data (can be placenames, but better if actual geospatial content like WKT)
* A qualified link to some sort of temporal metadata that SoSo is attempting to settle a pattern for

## Need to:

* Review [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) vs [DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm) and they could connect with [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)


Note that the two varmes show the concept of not presenting a value (ie, range of values) and one (stress) can have
a value

For property ID note we can have an array but prefer semantic descriptions

measurementTechnique should point to a method that is mature, globally adopted and opperational and / or endorsed by GOOS panel responsible for the EOV in question
These _should_ be at registered locations with PIDs like for example Zenodo


 "propertyID": ["http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001374", "https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/KeywordViewer/scheme/all/11aca777-8a01-42ce-b076-b3059c3d8cae"]
Here we have linked to GOOS but also GMCD via their keyword view with UUID value    NERC is at http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P14/current/GVAR0725/ but question about using


QA/QC notes:  QA/QC publishing principles should link to the exact methods used for QA/QC - not a general certification of a service or similar.

Hey Ward, Pieter:  here's where we're at, can OBIS' BioEco EOV specifications work with this?

## Science on Schema variableMeasured

Example from Science on Schema recommendations:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
    "gsn-quantity": "http://www.geoscienceontology.org/geo-lower/quantity#"
  },
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Removal of organic carbon by natural bacterioplankton communities as a function of pCO2 from laboratory experiments between 2012 and 2016",
  "variableMeasured": [
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "latitude",
      "propertyID":"http://www.geoscienceontology.org/geo-lower/quantity#latitude",
      "url": "https://www.sample-data-repository.org/dataset-parameter/665787",
      "description": "Latitude where water samples were collected; north is positive.",
      "unitText": "decimal degrees",
      "minValue": "45.0",
      "maxValue": "15.0"
    },
  ]
}
```

via [valueReference](https://schema.org/valueReference) we can get to Defined Term  (EVO)


## Science on Schema inDefinedTermSet

Defined Term  (not scoped in variableMeasured valid types)
```json
{
    "@id": "http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image",
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "inDefinedTermSet": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/DCMIType",
    "termCode": "Image",
    "name": "Image"
},
```
