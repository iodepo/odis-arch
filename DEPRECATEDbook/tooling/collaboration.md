# Collaboration

## About

Ocean InfoHub is a collaborative network.   To further support this and push the collaborative
nature we foster not only social but technical collaborative approaches.

With respect to the technical collaboration, this can most easily be seen in the GitHub
repository and the associated issus.

Where issues are a more asychronous event, we also often meet to address implementation and devlopment
work in real time approaches.  To support this, we leverage approaches that allow for real time distributed
work.
