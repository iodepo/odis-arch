    "## Introduction\n",
    "JSON-LD is a way of encoding Linked Data in JSON, the popular data interchange\n",
    "format used by many web APIs. Linked Data is a method of representing information\n",
    "on the web in a way that allows it to be linked and interconnected with other data.\n",
    "This allows data from different sources to be connected and used together in new\n",
    "and powerful ways. JSON-LD uses a standardized syntax to represent Linked Data,\n",
    "making it easier to integrate with other systems and tools. It is often used to\n",
    "add structured data to web pages, making it easier for search engines and other\n",
    "applications to understand and process the information on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provide a very brief introduction to the JSON-LD serialization format.  \n",
    "The [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) website has some detailed material and videos in\n",
    "their [documentation section](https://json-ld.org/learn.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The material here is just a brief introduction.   For this page we will be using\n",
    "a simplified version of a CreativeWork document. All the types used by OIH are defined\n",
    "by Schema.org types.  In this case it is [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Schema.org site you will find extensive details on what the various types mean and \n",
    "the full range of their properties. For OIH we are defining only a few of these properties \n",
    "as of interest in the [Thematic section](../thematics/index.md).  You are free to use additional\n",
    "properties to describe your resources.  It will not cause any issues, however, the OIH interfaces\n",
    "may not leverage them.  However, if you feel others would, or you use them yourself, it's encouraged\n",
    "to add them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following simple JSON-LD document to show the various features of the format. \n",

    "graph and is typically the identifier for the record.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "It should be noted this is the not the ID for the object being described but rather the record itself.\n",
    "If you are describing a dataset with a DOI, for example, the @id is not that DOI.  Rather it is the \n",
    "ID, potentially the URL, for the metadata record about that dataset.  Your dataset ID would be included\n",
    "in the metadata record using the the identifier property. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to ensure all your records have an @id property.  If there is no value then the \n",
    "resource is identified by what is known as a blank node.  Such identifiers do not allowing use in \n",
    "a Linked Open Data approach and are generally not recommended.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The @id should be the URL for the metadata record itself.  Not the HTML page the record is in.  However, \n",
    "these might be the same if use use content negotiation to select between HTML and JSON-LD representations\n",
    "of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type identifiers (@type)\n",

    "```{literalinclude} ../../../odis-in/dataGraphs/foundation/graphs/simple.json\n",
    ":emphasize-lines: 5\n",
    ":linenos:\n",

    "\n",
    "The next property to focus on is the @type property.  This describes the type of record we are describing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In Schema.org and in most vocabularies, types will be named with a capitol letter.  Properties on these\n",
    "types will be all lower case.  So, CreateWork, as a type, starts with a upper case C.  Then, name, as \n",
    "a property on the CreateWork type, starts with a lower case n.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For OIH these type for the various thematic profiles are defined in the documentation for the types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other properties\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we can return to look at the other properties for our type.  \n",

    ":emphasize-lines: 7-9\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, we are using Schema.org type for OIH.  In this case, as mentioned,\n",
    "this is type  [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork).  So any of the properties \n",
    "seen at the Schema.org site can be used.   The key properties of value to the OIH implementation can then \n",
    "be found, for this type, in the [Documents thematic type](../thematics/docs/index.md).\n",

    "\n",
    "In schema.org, the domain will be identified as \"Used on these types\", and the \n",

    "this at the [schema.org/knowsAbout](https://schema.org/knowsAbout) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thing and DataType\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Thing](https://schema.org/Thing) and [Datatype](https://schema.org/DataType) types \n",
    "are two special types we should mention.  Thing is the upper level and most generic\n",
    "type in schema.org.   Everything in schema.org is descended from Thing.  So when\n",
    "knowsAbout says its range includes Thing, it means you can use any type in schema.org\n",
    "as the value of that property.\n",
    "\n",
    "DataType is the basic data type Thing in schema.org and is a subclass of rdfs:Class.\n",
    "A DataType includes things like Integers, Strings, DateTime, etc.  So, using again\n",
    "knowsAbout, we see the range includes not only Thing by also the DataTypes Text \n",
    "and URL, where URL is actually a sub-type of Text."
