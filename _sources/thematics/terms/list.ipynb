    "with Defined Terms that point to external vocabularies that follow\n",
    "a vocabulary publishing patterns like at the W3C\n",
    "[Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern breaks down a bit when attempting to connect with things like \n",
    "the [Global Change Master Directory keywords](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/find-data/idn/gcmd-keywords).\n",
    "This impedance is caused by publishing approaches for the terms that don't align well with \n",
    "the above publishing practices.  This does not mean we can not use these terms, rather that\n",
    "we may find multiple ways to connect them used by the community.  This can result in some\n",
    "ambiguity in linking in a community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A person could adapt the pattern to connect things like the [Global Change Observing System](https://public.wmo.int/en/programmes/global-climate-observing-system/essential-climate-variables)\n",
    "or \n",

The later of these does have a UUID (6eb3919b-85ce-4988-8b78-9d0018fd8089) but this is not a dereference-able PID.\n",
