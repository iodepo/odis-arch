# Book Building

## About

The OIH book is built using Jupyter book.  This allows us to mix in exectuted and 
interactive elements while allow a static version in PDF or other formats to be built.

What follows are some not on how to build the book and some repository layout 
conventions we use.  

## Notes


```bash
jupyter-book clean . --all; jupyter-book build .;
```
