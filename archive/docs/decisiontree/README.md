# Decision Tree

## About

This is just an experiment with building decision trees using the d2lang.

This package can build out SVG from code and has ability to include both 
links and tooltips as part of the SVG produced.

These can be used interactively via a browser link and can also be included
into documentation.

We might be able to leverage these in some of our training and as a method
to expose views into the documentation.
