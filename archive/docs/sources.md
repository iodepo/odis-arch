# sources

This document lists a representative sample of data sources relevant to the OIH project. It is being used to explore the logical schema of properties and information that we will need in order to drive aspects of ODIS functionality. Our goal is to use re3data, a third party, global registry of data repositories/facilities as the core of this part of the architecture, maintaining little to no meta-information directly within ODIS infrastructure for these entities. The goal of this documentation exercise is to determine what information we can count on from a combination re3data registry and whatever the links provided from that registry enable us to query from the sources themselves. Gap analysis of our ODIS information needs and what we can get through links will help determine what holes ODIS needs to fill itself.

## Notes
* Three underlying principle that should be employed here and throughout ODIS architecture - everything that can be linked should be linked; everything that can be referenced should be referenced; everything that needs to be qualified should be qualified. In the case of our "sources" information and this developing schema, data types and region are two obvious elements that should be linked to some appropriate source that provide definition, reference, provenance, and expansion on the concepts.
* Per the linking policy, MarineRegions for ODIS will likely be the key source on gazetteer type of references to geographic areas of interest. It is the best available aggregation point for this type of information, but I know that certain systems like OBIS have had to make some design choices on how to use that source.
* Our concept of data types for ODIS may or may not align with the content types from re3data. This appears to be a standardized list. OBIS, for instance, references Scientific and statistical data formats, Structured graphics, Images, and Standard office documents. That's obviously different than what we started here. We should look at what re3data uses, decide if their semantics are sufficient for ODIS purposes, and chart our course. This could include guidance to our community on how to best employ the re3data model for our purposes, engagement with re3data on their terms, and/or going our own way.
