# Implementing Care Principles for Indigenous Data

## Introduction
[Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/) was founded to support Indigenous data sovereignty and cultural authority. Core to Local Contexts are [Indigenous data sovereignty](https://nni.arizona.edu/our-work/research-policy-analysis/indigenous-data-sovereignty-governance), the [CARE Principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care), and ethical and reciprocal partnerships.

Local Contexts is focused on increasing Indigenous involvement in data governance through the integration of Indigenous values into data systems. Local Contexts offers digital strategies for Indigenous communities, institutions, and researchers through the Traditional Knowledge (TK) & Biocultural (BC) Labels and Notices. Together they function as a practical mechanism to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous innovation.

In an increasingly complex legal, social, and cultural environment, the TK and BC Labels offer Indigenous communities a tool to add cultural and historical context and cultural authority to cultural heritage content in their own local digital heritage archives as well as in digital archives, libraries, museums, and other digital repositories globally.

The primary objectives of Local Contexts are to enhance and legitimize locally based decision-making and Indigenous governance frameworks for determining ownership, access, and culturally appropriate conditions for sharing historical, contemporary, and future collections of cultural heritage and Indigenous data.

## About
Indigenous and local communities can reinforce rights with the Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) Labels. The Engagement, Disclosure, and Collections Care Notices are a strategy for institutions, organizations, and researchers to disclose Indigenous interests and rights.

The Labels and Notices are extra-legal, educational strategies focused on provenance, protocols, and permissions that connect people and places to knowledge and data. Together, the Labels and Notices function to advance aspirations for Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous innovation.
