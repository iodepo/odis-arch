# Local Contexts Labels

## About
The Local Contexts Labels are tools for Indigenous communities and local organizations. Developed through sustained partnership and testing within Indigenous communities across multiple countries, the Labels allow communities to express local and specific conditions for sharing and engaging in future research and relationships in ways that are consistent with already existing community rules, governance, and protocols for using, sharing, and circulating knowledge and data. The Labels provide a practical application of the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. By establishing Indigenous cultural authority, the Labels clarify Indigenous and local community rights, interests, and relationships to collections and/or data.

There are two categories of Labels that are used within the Hub: Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Biocultural (BC) Labels. The **Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels** identify and clarify community-specific rules and responsibilities regarding access and future use of traditional knowledge. The **Biocultural (BC) Labels** define community expectations about the appropriate use of biocultural collections and data.
