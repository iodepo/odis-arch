# Local Contexts Notices

## About
The Notices are tools for institutions and researchers to identify Indigenous collections and data and recognize Indigenous rights and interests in collections and data.  The Notices were developed to create pathways for partnership, collaboration, and support of Indigenous cultural authority. They activate researcher and institutional responsibility to identify potential Indigenous rights and interests in historical and future collections, also operationalizing the CARE Principles.

There are two categories of Notices that are used within the Hub: Engagement and Disclosure Notices.

The **Engagement Notice** is used to indicate a researcher, institution, or service provider is committed to equitable engagement and ethical partnerships with Indigenous communities. This Notice is typically applied across a website, repository, etc. to indicate that the organization is committed to developing new modes of collaboration, engagement, and partnership over Indigenous collections and data that have colonial and/or problematic histories or unclear provenance.

The **Disclosure Notices** are used to identify Indigenous collections and data and to recognize there could be accompanying cultural rights, protocols, and responsibilities. The Disclosure Notices are for use by collecting institutions, data repositories, and organizations who engage in collaborative curation with Indigenous and other marginalized communities who have been traditionally excluded from processes of documentation and record keeping. The Notices are applied via Local Contexts Projects and can function as place-holders on collections, data, or in a sample field until a Label(s) is added by a community.
