Operational question:

The URL https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/ADEPZZ01/ is an example
of a type of depth we might be looking at.   How do we flag variables
and ensure we identify these for special treatment in the code?

The need to process the graph:
    * need to know the variable types to look for and how
    * need to parse out Z / M enabled geoSPARQL in the pipeline and augment the graph?


Graph augmentation for depth alignment?  The spatial element doesn' tdo it.
