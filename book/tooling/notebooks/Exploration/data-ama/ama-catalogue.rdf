    :description """Data on Marine Protected Areas (including their Take or No-Take status) was obtained from the Offshore
Marine Protected Area project (Sink et al. 2010), while data on terrestrial protected areas which have a
coastal element was obtained from the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy dataset (DEAT
SANBI, 2009) . Terrestrial protected areas were assigned to the "Take" category unless their entire
coastline was a "No-take" MPA. The Biodiversity Target of 20% was used in the evaluation, as is the
standard practice for all NBA 2010 assessments. In addition a supplementary "No-take" target was derived
from the marine offshore protected area targets contained in the National Protected Areas Expansion
Strategy (DEAT SANBI, 2009), which includes targets for marine protection at 20% (i.e. the same as the
biodiversity target) , and a "No-take" target of 15% of the habitat. The level of protection of each ecosystem
was evaluated against the 20% biodiversity target, and then "No-take" areas were evaluated against the
15% target. The protection levels were defined according to the following categories. Ecosystems were
classified as "Not protected" if there was no formal protection; as "Hardly protected" if under 5% of target
was met in protected areas; as "Poorly protected" if from 5% to just under 50% of biodiversity target is met
in protected areas; as "Moderately protected" if from 50% to just under 100% of the Biodiversity target is
met in protected areas; and as "Well protected" if the biodiversity targets are fully met and the No-take
target is met. Ecosystems where the biodiversity targets are fully met but where there is insufficient Notake
area, were down-graded to a "Moderately protected" classification.""" ;

The database also includes all original documents of the treaties concerning these borders (in digital format). Through a forum on the MARBOUND website users can contribute to the further development and optimization of the MARBOUND database by providing information about new border developments.

The concept of maritime boundaries is a relative new concept. Coastal states now want to delimit an area in the ocean where they have exclusive rights over the mineral and biological resources.

The basis for the calculation of maritime boundaries is the declaration of a baseline. The conditions under which a state may establish such baseline are described in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A baseline of a country can be the low water line, a straight baseline (a line that encloses bays, estuaries, inland waters,...) or a combination of the two.

The zone extending 12 Nautical Miles from the baseline is the Territorial Sea and the zone extending 24 Nautical Miles is the Contiguous Zone of a country.

The legal Exclusive Economic Zone is the zone extending 200 Nautical Miles from the baseline. When the space between two countries is less than 400 Nautical Miles, the boundary should be the Median Line or should be described in a multilateral treaty.

Multilateral treaties and documents describing the baselines of countries can be found on the website of the United Nations.""" ;

It is also available from the World Wide Web (linked from the online linkage noted above and anonymous ftp.        Improvements to the global model are anticipated, as appropriate data and/or methods are made available.  In addition, individual contributions to GLOBE (several areas have more than one candidate) should become available at the same website. GLOBE may be used for technology development, such as helping plan infrastructure for cellular communications networks, other public works, satellite data processing, and environmental monitoring and analysis.  GLOBE prototypes (and probably GLOBE itself after its release) have been used to help develop terrain avoidance systems for aircraft.  In all cases, GLOBE data should be treated as any potentially useful but guaranteed imperfect data set. Mission- or life-critical applications should consider the documented artifacts, as well as likely undocumented imperfections, in the data." ;

    :description """Derivation of ecosystem Threat status for features
The ecosystem threat status of a feature was determined by evaluating the area of each feature in a
condition against thresholds or targets. This method is designed to give comparable answers and
categories for the marine environment to those used in the South African National terrestrial, freshwater
and estuarine conservation assessments, and to ensure that the assessment remains within a systematic
framework. The methodology and categories also allows quick conceptual links to be made to IUCN Red
List categories for species which are immediately understood by a broad range of biologists and
conservationists.
Biodiversity threshold (Targets): The basic biodiversity thresholds were set at 20% of the area of each
ecosystem type. The 20% target is a default value commonly used in South Africa when targets derived
from the underlying characteristics (e.g. species area curves) of biodiversity features are not available. A
review of targets for marine systems is being undertaken by the South African National Biodiversity
Institute, which will inform target setting for marine ecosystems in the future.
The ecosystem threat status of an ecosystem was determined by evaluating the area of each feature in a
specific condition state against thresholds or targets. A number of categories were defined that are
comparable with those used in the South African National terrestrial, freshwater and estuarine conservation
assessments (Driver et al. 2005). The categories were:
Critically Endangered: These are ecosystems where the remaining area in good condition is less than the
identified biodiversity threshold (20% of habitat). Conceptually, these are features where there are almost
no remaining areas of pristine or natural habitat, and we expect that important components of biodiversity
pattern have been lost and processes are heavily modified.
Endangered: These are ecosystems where the remaining area in good condition is less than the identified
biodiversity threshold plus 15% (i.e. 35% of habitat). Conceptually, this is a "red flag" category for systems
that are approaching the point where important components of biodiversity pattern will be lost, and which
already have significant impacts on processes.
Vulnerable: These are features where the remaining area in good condition is greater than the identified
biodiversity threshold plus 15% (i.e. are not Critically Endangered or Endangered), but where the remaining
area of good or fair condition habitat is less than 80% of habitat area. Conceptually, these are habitats
where there are sufficient areas of intact biodiversity of this type to meet our targets, but outside of these
areas there has been broad loss of ecosystem processes.
Least threatened: These are features where the remaining area in good condition is greater than the
identified biodiversity threshold plus 15% (i.e. they are not Critically Endangered or Endangered), but
where the remaining area of good or fair condition habitat is greater than 80% of habitat area.
Conceptually, there are sufficient areas of intact biodiversity of this type to meet our biodiversity target, and
there has been little broad modification of processes. Large portions of these systems remain in a natural
or pristine state.""" ;

    :description """A key objective of Ghana’s decentralization programme is the promotion of small towns, particularly district capitals, as a means of reducing rural-urban migration and the rapid growth of large towns and cities. While small towns have grown significantly in both number and population over the last three decades, the proportion of the total urban population living in these urban centres has changed very little or has even declined slightly. This contradicts the view that the growth and proliferation of small towns is leading to declining growth rates of the larger urban centres. This conclusion leads to the question of whether there is a justification for the promotion of small towns under Ghana’s decentralization programme. This article examines the reasons accounting for the growth of small towns and concludes that promoting small towns, especially the district capitals under the current decentralization programme, is a positive response to rural development and the development of dispersed urbanization in the long term.

Urban centres in Ghana are officially defined as settlements with populations of 5000 or more.[10] Besides other limitations, definitions of this sort significantly failed to delimit the various urban hierarchies found within each country or region.
It is impossible to give total protection to the entire coastline against oil pollution from navigation or oil exploration and exploitation activities. It is therefore necessary to carefully plan how to minimise the risk for the most sensitive and important areas and further to prioritise the oil spill combat activities in the event of oil pollution threatening the marine environment and the coastal zone areas.

Mapping the ecological and human use features sensitive to marine oil spill, the coastline ?eld surveys and aerial photography was classi?ed into different geological coast types. Protected areas and areas that serve as important habitats for birds, ?sh, plankton, marine turtles, marine mammals and benthic fauna were mapped. Marine turtles nest on many of the sandy beaches in Ghana. The juvenile turtles are very sensitive to oil spill in the period shortly after hatching. Furthermore there are more than 90 lagoons along the coast serving as important areas for migrating birds and spawning areas for ?sh. The human use activities depending on access to marine resources such as ?shery, hotels and recreation, water intakes etc. were also mapped. The ?shing industry is one of the most promising in West Africa, in terms of resources and experience of the people engaged in the industry. All the data was stored in a GIS database.

Ranking of the coastline: Ecological features and Human use features where subsequently ranked in four categories in terms of sensitivity to oil spill: Very high sensitivity, High sensitivity, Medium sensitivity, and Low sensitivity.  The entire coastline was sub-divided into segments of 1 km. Each segment was ranked according to ecological sensitivity of oil spill and human use features separately. The most sensitive feature in each particular segment determines the overall rank.

Three main classifications can be made: small towns, medium-sized/intermediate towns, and large towns/cities. Adding rural settlements, Ghana’s settlement hierarchy can be placed within a four-tier system. At the top of Ghana’s urban hierarchy are the large towns/cities of Accra, Kumasi, Tema and Sekondi-Takoradi, with populations of 250,000 or more. This is followed by the intermediate (medium-sized) towns with populations of 50,000 to 250,000, typified by the regional capitals. After this are the small towns, exemplified by district capitals/administrative centres with populations between 5000 and 50,000. Lastly, there are rural settlements. It should be noted that this classification and the definitions are for the purpose of analyses and discussions in this article since no official definitions exist in Ghana other than the official definition of an urban centre.""" ;

Improvements to the global model are anticipated, as appropriate data and/or methods are made available.

GLOBE may be used for technology development, such as helping plan infrastructure for cellular communications networks, other public works, satellite data processing, and environmental monitoring and analysis.  GLOBE prototypes (and probably GLOBE itself after its release) have been used to help develop terrain avoidance systems for aircraft.  In all cases, GLOBE data should be treated as any potentially useful but guaranteed imperfect data set.

Method of data acquisition:Based on one year of observations in 1984 using satellite imagery (Olivier, J. 1995. Spatial distribution of fog in the Namib. Journal of arid environments, 29:129-138.). Fog is recorded when visibility on compilation: the ground is reduced to 1,000 m or less. The polygons making up the shapefile were created from hand drawn contours on a hard copy map. This manual interpolation approach was done by Peter Hutchinson using the point data from all available stations. Because the number of stations was small an automatic interpolation produced nonsense results.""" ;

The 2000 global ecological zone map has been developed, building upon the FRA 1990 experience for the tropics and extending the coverage to include the temperate and boreal forests. A globally consistent classification has been adopted, based on the Koppen-Trewartha climate system in combination with natural vegetation characteristics. A total of 19 global ecological zones have been defined and mapped, ranging from the evergreen tropical rainforest zone to the boreal tundra woodland zone. A main principle of delineating the global ecological zones involved the aggregation or matching of available regional ecological or potential vegetation maps into the global framework." ;

    :description """In 1996 an Oil Spill Contingency Plan was prepared for the coast of Ghana. The Contingency Plan should raise the level of awareness and competence of the various parties involved to ensure that a high level of oil spill response preparedness is achieved and maintained. One element in this plan is an Environmental Sensitivity Map, which will be an important tool in the planning of the development along the coastline as well as in the preparation of licensing for petroleum exploration offshore Ghana.

It is impossible to give total protection to the entire coastline against oil pollution from navigation or oil exploration and exploitation activities. It is therefore necessary to carefully plan how to minimise the risk for the most sensitive and important areas and further to prioritise the oil spill combat activities in the event of oil pollution threatening the marine environment and the coastal zone areas.

Mapping the ecological and human use features sensitive to marine oil spill, the coastline, field surveys and aerial photography was classified into different geological coast types. Protected areas and areas that serve as important habitats for birds, fish, plankton, marine turtles, marine mammals and benthic fauna were mapped. Marine turtles nest on many of the sandy beaches in Ghana. The juvenile turtles are very sensitive to oil spill in the period shortly after hatching. Furthermore there are more than 90 lagoons along the coast serving as important areas for migrating birds and spawning areas for fish. The human use activities depending on access to marine resources such as fishery, hotels and recreation, water intakes etc. were also mapped. The fishing industry is one of the most promising in West Africa, in terms of resources and experience of the people engaged in the industry. All the data was stored in a GIS database.

Ranking of the coastline: Ecological features and Human use features where subsequently ranked in four categories in terms of sensitivity to oil spill: Very high sensitivity, High sensitivity, Medium sensitivity, and Low sensitivity.  The entire coastline was sub-divided into segments of 1 km. Each segment was ranked according to ecological sensitivity of oil spill and human use features separately. The most sensitive feature in each particular segment determines the overall rank.""" ;

    :description """The maritime boundaries provide a useful tool to limit national marine areas, but do not include information on marine regional and sub regional seas. This hampers the usage of these boundaries for implementing nature conservation strategies or analyzing marine biogeographic patterns. For example, a species occurring in the German EEZ can live in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea or Kattegat area. Each of these different marine areas has very distinct hydrological, oceanographic and ecological conditions.

Therefore, by combining the information on regional seas and national maritime boundaries, we can include both a environmental and managerial factor. We propose to overlay the information from the maritime boundaries (the Exclusive Economic Zones) with the IHO Sea Areas (IHO, 1953). This map including the global oceans and seas, has been drafted for hydrographic purposes, but also gives an unequivocal and acceptable distinction of the regional seas and oceans from an oceanographic point of view. The combination of these two boundaries allows us for example to create national regional sea areas for the global ocean.

The remaining areas of good quality, primary vegetation were identified from this map and was then classified into two major types, one evergreen (eastern and central) and the other deciduous (western and southern). The evergreen forests include the humid forests (at low, medium and high altitudes), along with the sclerophyllous woodland remnants (Uapaca dominated) of central Madagascar. The deciduous formations include the seasonally dry forests of the west and north, and the southern, dry forests and scrublands." ;

    :description "A historical review of vegetation classification in Madagascar reveals that the classical map and \"phytogeographic\" territories of Perrier de la Bâthie and Humbert are largely a subjective reflection of climatological factors, and do not adequately reflect fundamental biogeographic patterns. Delimitation of phytochoria based on the distribution patterns of taxa provides an objective framework for comparing and mapping vegetation types using a simple physiognomic classification. The application of this approach in Madagascar would make it possible to test the validity of the classical divisions and circumscribe alternative ones, and to determine the current extent of natural and anthropogenic formations (principally secondary grasslands, often called \"prairies\", \"pseudosteppes\", etc., which cover about three quarters of the country). Before the arrival of man, the original woody vegetation types in the drier west (forest, woodland, bushland, etc.) were in a fragile equilibrium and could quickly have been converted to secondary grassland by fires; in the moister center more active human intervention (clearing) was likely required to alter the vegetation. Contrary to recent claims, native grasslands were not widespread immediately prior to the arrival of humans, but were probably restricted to small patches. Today, human impacts can be seen in all Malagasy vegetation types, even supposedly undisturbed \"native\" forest." ;

It is also available from the World Wide Web (linked from the online linkage noted above and anonymous ftp.        Improvements to the global model are anticipated, as appropriate data and/or methods are made available.  In addition, individual contributions to GLOBE (several areas have more than one candidate) should become available at the same website. GLOBE may be used for technology development, such as helping plan infrastructure for cellular communications networks, other public works, satellite data processing, and environmental monitoring and analysis.  GLOBE prototypes (and probably GLOBE itself after its release) have been used to help develop terrain avoidance systems for aircraft.  In all cases, GLOBE data should be treated as any potentially useful but guaranteed imperfect data set. Mission- or life-critical applications should consider the documented artifacts, as well as likely undocumented imperfections, in the data." ;

Here, a great “river” of seawater, the Agulhas Current, warms the shallows over a broad continental shelf, and a variety of reef types--including fringing, barrier and bank reefs--have developed. The world’s third-largest network of coral reefs lies off the southwestern coast. Called the Toliara or Tulear reef system, this tract spans close to 200 miles between the vicinity of the Mangoky River mouth to the north and the community of Androka to the south. According to the \"World Atlas of Coral Reefs,\" the Tulear reefs sport at least 130 species of stony coral and 700 kinds of fish. Andavadoaka-area reefs, only recently systematically surveyed, are also species-rich. But, like many coral systems worldwide, they have suffered mightily from bleaching, wherein coral polyps lose their symbiotic algae. In 2006, National Geographic reported that a survey of the reefs off the southwestern coast by the groups Blue Ventures, and the Wildlife Conservation Society suggested that some corals there might be resistant to bleaching." ;

The original product comprises three map sheets at a scale of 1:5,000,000. These maps were digitized by GRID in their original Miller Oblated Stereographic Projection, and later rasterized at a cell (pixel) size of 30 seconds latitude/longitude resolution (approximately one-kilometer square). The digital product distributed by GRID covers the entire continent of Africa and Madagascar in a single data file.
The Vegetation Map of Africa is a compendium of various existing map sources for different regions/countries, which were integrated and synthesized by the AETFAT committee responsible for creating the map (headed by Dr. F. White of Oxford University, UK). The first draft of the map was checked by extensive fieldwork and discussions with local experts. The vegetation classification used is the UNESCO standard based on physiognomy and floristic composition (not climate), and it includes a total of 80 major vegetation types and mosaics. Water is added as category 81 in the GRID legend for the digital map.
The UNESCO (White's) Vegetation Map for Africa data file provided by GRID consists of 8989 rows (lines, records) by 8939 columns(elements/pixels/samples) of data, and one byte/eight bits per pixel. The data file origin (upper-left or northwest corner) is located at 40 degrees, 6 minutes and 45 seconds (40 deg. 6' 45") North latitude and 23 degrees 5 minutes (23 deg. 5') West longitude, and it extends to the southeast, covering the entire African continent. The projection is "Geographic" (Lat/Long reference system), and at 30 seconds latitude/longitude spatial resolution, this data file comprises 80.35 Megabytes. The complete and proper reference to this data set is as follows: "White, Frank; 1983; Vegetation of Africa - a descriptive memoir to accompany the

    :description """Les écosystèmes côtiers et marins de la planète, y compris ceux de l’OIO, sont de plus en
plus exposés à une multitude de facteurs de changement. L’identification, la quantification
et la cartographie des facteurs de changement représentent une étape importante dans le
processus de planification de la conservation et pour la gestion des écosystèmes. Dans cette
étude, nous avons identifié 15 facteurs de changement anthropiques qui peuvent être
regroupés en 8 catégories : pêche industrielle pélagique, pêche côtière, pêche à pied,
sédimentation terrigène, pollution des bassins versants par les activités urbaines et
agricoles, dégradations locales dues aux activités urbaines, tourisme et transport maritime.
Les facteurs de changement ont été cartographiés en utilisant plusieurs techniques d’analyse
spatiale dont celle de la logique floue, de l’analyse de voisinage et l’analyse d’image satellite
océanographique. Les 8 catégories de facteurs de changement ont ensuite été classées et
pondérées par des experts de la région réunis au cours d’un atelier, sur la base de leur
impact potentiel sur les cinq principaux types d’habitats : récifs coralliens, mangroves,
herbiers, autres habitats côtiers et habitats pélagiques (profondeur > 200m, distance de la
côte > 25km). Afin de développer un système de pondération valide, nous avons utilisé un
processus analytique de hiérarchie basé sur la comparaison par paires de facteurs de
changement.
L’objectif était d’étudier une partie des facteurs de changement (FdC) dans l’OIO et de
cartographier leur distribution spatiale et leur intensité en se basant sur des données de
télédétection et socio-économiques et en utilisant les techniques de modélisation spatiale
des SIG.
La technique de logique floue et l’analyse d’images satellites ont été utilisées pour
cartographier les FdC. La logique floue est une forme d’algèbre utilisant une gamme de
valeurs comprises entre « vrai » et faux » qui est appliquée dans la cartographie de données
imprécises ou peu sûres (Ross 2004). Les données sont codées de 0 à 1 rapportant à une
fonction d’appartenance floue. Par exemple, une valeur de 1 indique qu’un site est
fortement affecté par un FdC alors qu’une valeur de 0 indique que le site ne fait pas partie
de la catégorie des sites affectés""" ;

The dataset represents the initial static boundaries developed at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Canada. Note that the boundaries of these provinces are not fixed in time and space, but are dynamic and move under seasonal and interannual changes in physical forcing. At the first level of reduction, Longhurst recognised four principal biomes (also referred to as domains in earlier publications): the Polar Biome, the Westerlies Biome, the Trade-Winds Biome, and the Coastal Boundary Zone Biome. These four Biomes are recognisable in every major ocean basin. At the next level of reduction, the ocean basins are partitioned into provinces, roughly ten for each basin. These partitions provide a template for data analysis or for making parameter assignments on a global scale." ;

coastline was a "No-take" MPA. The Biodiversity Target of 20% was used in the evaluation, as is the
standard practice for all NBA 2010 assessments. In addition a supplementary "No-take" target was derived
from the marine offshore protected area targets contained in the National Protected Areas Expansion
Strategy (DEAT SANBI, 2009), which includes targets for marine protection at 20% (i.e. the same as the
biodiversity target) , and a "No-take" target of 15% of the habitat. The level of protection of each ecosystem
was evaluated against the 20% biodiversity target, and then "No-take" areas were evaluated against the
15% target. The protection levels were defined according to the following categories. Ecosystems were
classified as "Not protected" if there was no formal protection; as "Hardly protected" if under 5% of target
was met in protected areas; as "Poorly protected" if from 5% to just under 50% of biodiversity target is met
in protected areas; as "Moderately protected" if from 50% to just under 100% of the Biodiversity target is
met in protected areas; and as "Well protected" if the biodiversity targets are fully met and the No-take
target is met. Ecosystems where the biodiversity targets are fully met but where there is insufficient Notake
area, were down-graded to a "Moderately protected" classification.""" ;

Mangroves are under increasing pressure as terrestrial forests dwindle, Agricultural lands are fully occupied elsewhere leading to migration into once undisturbed mangroves. The reduction in terrestrial forest cover has led to more and more harvesting of mangrove timber which, at the same time, is increasingly prized for its construction versatility, value as charcoal and resistance to parasites. The search for new agricultural lands has led to locally extensive clearing of mangroves.

Et comme cette population n’est urbanisée qu’à environ 15%, on comprendra que les grandes agglomérations soient rares. Les plus importantes sont Antananarivo, la capitale nationale et les cinq chefs-lieux des anciennes Provinces, soit par ordre alphabétique, Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, Mahajanga, Toamasina et Toliara.

Aux temps coloniaux, bien avant la suppression des six provinces et leur remplacement par les vingt-deux régions actuelles, le nom de ces six villes que les colonisateurs ne parvenaient pas à prononcer avait été changé en Tananarive, Diégo Suarez, Fianarantsoa, Majunga, Tamatave et Tuléar, des noms qui ont toujours été rejetés par les autochtones.

Ces villes ont fini par retrouver leur identité initiale peu après l’indépendance en 1960. Avec le grand changement politique de 2002 et la mise en place de la décentralisation, elles ont presque toutes perdu une bonne partie de leur importance administrative et politique, mais non leur poids démographique et économique. C’est d’ailleurs ce dernier facteur qui nous a conduit à leur ajouter deux ports : l’un à l’extrême Sud-est qui se développe énormément en raison de l’exploitation et l’exportation de l’ilménite, minerais dont on extrait le titane et le second dans le creux de la côte ouest, avec un arrière-pays prometteur au plan charbonnier (Sakoa) et pétrolier (Bemolanga).

    :description """L’âge des chemins de fer à Madagascar risque fort d’avoir été bref. De 1901, qui vit l’ouverture du premier chantier, à 1936, un embryon de réseau de quelque 860 kilomètres fut constitué. Mais, en 2001 sur les 4 lignes qui le composaient, seul le FCE (Fianarantsoa-Côte-Est, 163 km) était encore animé par un modeste convoi quotidien, alors même que le problème des transports était plus aigu que jamais. Depuis, le TCE (Tananarive-Côte-Est, 369 km) a repris du service pour l’acheminement de pondéreux, les hydrocarbures principalement. Mais la tentative de remise en service du TA (Tananarive-Antsirabe, 158 km) s’est soldée par un déraillement de bien mauvais augure. Dans le contexte politique et idéologique actuel qui privilégie la privatisation de toutes les activités économiques, l’avenir des chemins de fer malgaches est plus qu’incertain.

2 Or incriminer la mauvaise gestion des Républiques successives depuis 1960 n’est pas une explication suffisante. Car une analyse remontant aux origines de ces voies ferrées fait apparaître clairement que l’entreprise a été dès l’origine mal pensée et encore plus mal exécutée. Le calcul économique resta déficient, ce qui rendait illusoires les espérances de développement, elles-mêmes obérées par de sévères contraintes, qu’il s’agisse des conditions de financement, du parasitisme d’intérêts particuliers ou d’effets pervers source de blocage économique. Et surtout, la réalisation fut menée au prix d’un coût social et humain très élevé, qui éclaire notamment les origines de l’insurrection de 1947 dont les chemins de fer furent les axes et la cible, et au-delà, l’hostilité des populations à une modernité toujours perçue comme oppressive.""" ;

Certains virages tracés sommairement dans OSM peuvent aussi réduire le total. Enfin, les chiffres gouvernementaux ne sont pas fiables non plus. 
Le Document de stratégie pays pour Madagascar au titre du 9ième FED a adopté comme secteurs prioritaires de financement pour la période 2000-2007: les infrastructures routières et le développement rural.

Les interventions, initialement déployées dans tout Madagascar, ont été concentrées depuis 2002 sur les régions du Sud (Fianarantsoa et Toliara), zones identifiées alors comme les plus pauvres.

Dans le domaine des infrastructures, le bilan global est positif. De nombreux ouvrages ont été inaugurés et le réseau routier national s'est nettement amélioré, notamment le réseau reliant la capitale aux quatre principaux ports du pays et les autres routes nationales, desservant les régions productrices de cultures à l'exportation.

L'amélioration des cultures de rente et des filières d'exportation a porté sur la diversification horticole, la normalisation agricole, la promotion des cultures de rente et la surveillance des pêches. Les programmes de structuration du monde rural ont permis de renforcer l'environnement productif du monde paysan (micro finances, services agricoles) et ont facilité l'émergence de leaders dans le milieu rural. Les programmes de développement local ont reflété, quant à eux, une évolution importante de la coopération avec la CE, des micro réalisations vers le financement direct et l'aménagement du territoire local.

Pour de plus amples informations sur les projets et programmes à Madagascar financés par le FED et le budget général de l'UE, veuillez visiter la section projet du site de la Délégation de l'Union européenne à Madagascar.""" ;

It continues much in the tradition of the National Geophysical Data Center's TerrainBase (FGDC 1090), as TerrainBase served as a generally lower-resolution prototype of GLOBE data management and compilation techniques. The GLOBE mosaic has been compiled onto CD-ROMs for the international user community.  It is also available from the World Wide Web (linked from the online linkage noted above and anonymous ftp.        Improvements to the global model are anticipated, as appropriate data and/or methods are made available.  In addition, individual contributions to GLOBE (several areas have more than one candidate) should become available at the same website. GLOBE may be used for technology development, such as helping plan infrastructure for cellular communications networks, other public works, satellite data processing, and environmental monitoring and analysis.  GLOBE prototypes (and probably GLOBE itself after its release) have been used to help develop terrain avoidance systems for aircraft.  In all cases, GLOBE data should be treated as any potentially useful but guaranteed imperfect data set.
