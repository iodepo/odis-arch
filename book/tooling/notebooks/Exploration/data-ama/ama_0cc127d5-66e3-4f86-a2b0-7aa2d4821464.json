    "description": "‘Remaining Primary Vegetation, classified by the Underlying Geology’ was produced by overlaying the map of ‘Remaining Primary Vegetation’ (derived from satellite imagery) on a map of ‘Simplified Geology’. This map provides new insights into the patterns of distributions of plant species, and the various types of vegetation, especially in western and southern Madagascar where the geology varies substantially.",
