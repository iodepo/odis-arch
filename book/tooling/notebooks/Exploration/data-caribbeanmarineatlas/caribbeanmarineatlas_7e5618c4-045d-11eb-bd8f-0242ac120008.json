    "description": "<p>A bacteriological water quality survey was conducted during the period 14 April to 15 July, 2015 along the southwestern coastline of Trinidad, from Guapo Beach to Clifton Hill Beach, Point Fortin. Guapo Beach and Clifton Hill Beach are used for recreational activities by beachgoers.Thirteen (13) sampling stations were located nearshore along western Guapo Bay, from Guapo Beach to Clifton Hill Beach. Three (3) stations were also established at Guapo River, at a drain and at a stream which discharged into nearshore waters and were potential sources of pollution for this section of western Guapo Bay. Water samples were collected on eight (8) occasions at thirteen (13) nearshore stations. The three (3) potential sources of pollution were tested whenever available at the time of nearshore sample collection. Faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci bacteria were used as indicators of possible contamination from sewage.</p>",
