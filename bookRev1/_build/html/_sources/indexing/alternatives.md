# Alternatives

## Options

While [Gleaner](https://gleaner.io/) will be used during initial OIH development it is not
the only or required approach.   The web architecture foundation means there are many other tools that
can be used and might be leveraged in a production environment including:

* [Extrunct](https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct)
* [BioSchemas Tools](https://bioschemas.org/software)
* [LDSpider](https://github.com/ldspider/ldspider)
* [StormCrawler](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler)
* [Squirrel](https://dice-group.github.io/squirrel.github.io/overview.html)
* [Nutch (Apache)](http://nutch.apache.org/)
* [Laundromat](https://github.com/LOD-Laundromat/LOD-Laundromat)
* [DataArchiver](https://github.com/websi96/datasetarchiver)
* [OD Archiver](https://archiver.ai.wu.ac.at/)

These different tools may better fit into the workflow and available
skill sets for a group.
