In an increasingly data-driven digital landscape, sharing information about your resources on the web has become a vital endeavor. Structured data, presented through JSON-LD, offers an approachable means to achieve this goal, providing context and linked data in a format easily understood by both humans and machines. Through the incorporation of schema.org, a collaborative initiative designed to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the internet, this guide will help you navigate the process of sharing JSON-LD for your web resources. In this guide, we'll walk you through the key steps to effectively share JSON-LD on the web for your resource, empowering you to enhance discoverability and semantic context for your valuable content.

### 1.1

**Defining Structured Data and JSON-LD:** Structured data is the practice of organizing and presenting data on the web in a way that provides clear context and relationships between different pieces of information. JSON-LD, which stands for JSON for Linked Data, is a popular format for expressing structured data using JSON syntax. It allows you to create machine-readable content that can be easily understood by search engines, making it an effective method for enhancing the visibility and comprehensibility of your web resources.

### 1.2

**The Role of Schema.org and the FAIR Principles:** Schema.org, a collaborative initiative, plays a crucial role in the structured data landscape. It is closely aligned with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, which aim to improve the accessibility and usability of data. By using schema.org, you're not only making your data more findable but also contributing to its accessibility and interoperability. This means that your structured data becomes more reusable by other systems, researchers, and organizations, reinforcing the FAIR principles and promoting a global data-sharing ecosystem. In this guide, we will show you how to leverage these concepts to efficiently share your JSON-LD data on the web.
