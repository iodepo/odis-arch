## Using OIH search in Chrome

It is possible to set Ocean InfoHub as a search shortcut in Chrome.
To do this go to the _Mange Search ..._ section of your settings. 

There you will see a button "Add" in the _Site Search_ section.

You can make an entry like: __https://search.oceaninfohub.org/results/?search_text=%s&page=0__

The shortcut, here _oih_ can be used in the address bar to quickly invoke this search.

Simple type: _oih_ or whatever you set the shortcut to and then hit the tab key.  The address bar will convert to a search mode where you can type your search and hit return.
