    "description": "Days of fog in Namibia\nSource: Atlas of Namibia, Directorate of Environmental Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Environment and Tourism of Namibia - can be downloaded from Internet\nMethod of data acquisition:Based on one year of observations in 1984 using satellite imagery (Olivier, J. 1995. Spatial distribution of fog in the Namib. Journal of arid environments, 29:129-138.). Fog is recorded when visibility on compilation: the ground is reduced to 1,000 m or less. The polygons making up the shapefile were created from hand drawn contours on a hard copy map. This manual interpolation approach was done by Peter Hutchinson using the point data from all available stations. Because the number of stations was small an automatic interpolation produced nonsense results.",
