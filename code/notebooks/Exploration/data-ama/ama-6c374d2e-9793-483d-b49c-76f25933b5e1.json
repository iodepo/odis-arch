    "description": "The Earth Observing System (EOS) Science Team MODIS Level 2 global SST (MOD28) is a daily global 1 km clear-sky infrared SST product (Brown and Minnett 1999) available from the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) and in real-time from the University of South Florida, Tampa. The MOD28 SST product uses a linear retrieval equation based on the AVHRR algorithm. SST is calculated using two infrared channels of MODIS which are regressed to reference SSTs, normally Reynold’s SST or the brightness temperature at 3.7 ?m, and corrects for the effects of the atmosphere on the spectral radiances. For the May 2004 period SST data was obtained from the DAAC, and cloud contaminated pixels of SST were removed by applying the EOS MOD35 cloud mask product.",
