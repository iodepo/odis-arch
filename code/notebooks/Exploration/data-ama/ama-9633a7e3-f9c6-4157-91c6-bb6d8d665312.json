    "description": "This map is a simplified version of the vegetation map of FARAMALALA (1988 &1995), which was derived from LANDSAT satellite imagery, and broadly maintained the vegetation zones defined by HUMBERT (1955). The remaining areas of good quality, primary vegetation were identified from this map and was then classified into two major types, one evergreen (eastern and central) and the other deciduous (western and southern). The evergreen forests include the humid forests (at low, medium and high altitudes), along with the sclerophyllous woodland remnants (Uapaca dominated) of central Madagascar. The deciduous formations include the seasonally dry forests of the west and north, and the southern, dry forests and scrublands.",
