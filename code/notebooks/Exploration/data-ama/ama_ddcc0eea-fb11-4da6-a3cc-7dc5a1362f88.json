    "description": "Tsunami events and effects in the BCLME region (Angola, Namibia, South Africa). NOAA / NGDC and the co-located World Data Center have compiled a unique set of tsunami-related products as part of a continuing program to support the interests of engineers, oceanographers, seismologists, and the general public. The Global Historical Tsunami Database provides information on tsunami source events and locations where effects from tsunamis were observed world wide. It contains events from 2000 B.C. to the present including source location, date, and time, event magnitude, maximum water height, total number of deaths, injuries and damage for the event. Runup information includes arrival date and time, travel time, maximum water heights, horizontal inundation distances, deaths, injuries, and damage for specific locations. Runups are also related to appropriate instrumental tide gauge and tsunameter data.",
