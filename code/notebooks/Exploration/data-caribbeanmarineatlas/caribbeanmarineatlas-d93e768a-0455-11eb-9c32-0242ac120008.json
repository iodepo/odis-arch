    "description": "The bacteriological water quality and physico–chemical parameters were measured along the south western coast of Tobago, to monitor and evaluate bathing beach water quality and identify possible sources of faecal contamination. One bacterial indicator namely enterococci was chosen for this study, and was analysed by defined substrate technology (Enterolert) in accordance with the IDEXX protocol. The physico–chemical parameters collected were pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, turbidity and rainfall. Single day sampling was collected at 12 offshore locations during the wet and dry season for 2017 and 2018.  Bacterial concentrations at four of the twelve sampling stations were not within the USEPA water quality standards for recreational use during the wet season.",
