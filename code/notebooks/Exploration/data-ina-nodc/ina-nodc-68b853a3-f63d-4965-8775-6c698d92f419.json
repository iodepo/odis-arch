    "description": "XBT (Expendable Bathy Thermograph Data) dataset observed from XBT measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists temperature parameter. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 194.530 stations data and more than 88.006.759 samples data from August 7, 1962.
