    "description": "DRB (Drifting Buoy Data) dataset observed from drifting buoy measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity and oxygen. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more 307 stations data and more 2.971 samples data from January 13, 2000. It was identified that United States had made observations using drifting buoy measurement.",
