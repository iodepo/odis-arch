    "description": "MBT (Mechanical Bathy Thermograph Data) dataset observed from MBT measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists temperature parameter. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 134.157 stations data and more than 2.513.700 samples data from January 1st, 1951. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia, Canada, Chile, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand and United States had made observations using MBT measurement.",
