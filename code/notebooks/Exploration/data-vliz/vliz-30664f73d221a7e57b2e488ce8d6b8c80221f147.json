    "description": "The Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60 / EC) stipulates that all European surface waters must be at least in a good chemical state (natural waters, heavily modified and artificial waters) by 2015. The main objective of the Long-Term Vision 2030 of the Scheldt Estuary  was to otbtain a healthy estuarine ecosystem in which water quality is no longer limiting. This measurement indicates the evolution, in whether or not achieving the European objective, which is further juridically mentioned in the Water Act in the Netherlands and the Decree Integrated Water Policy (DIW) in Flanders.",
