    "description": "The EMODnet Biology products include a set of gridded map layers showing the average abundance of marine species for different time windows (seasonal, annual) using geospatial modelling. The spatial modelling tool used to calculate the gridded abundance maps is based on DIVA. DIVA (Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis) is a tool to create gridded data sets from discrete point measurements of the ocean. For the representation of time dynamics, it was decided to produce gridded maps for sliding time windows, e.g. combining one or more years  in one gridded map, so that relatively smooth animated GIF presentations can be produced that show the essential change over time. EMODnet Biology’s data products include the Operational Ocean Products and Services (OOPS), harvested by ICES.",
