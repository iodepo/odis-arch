    "description": "These maps were constructed based on the descriptions given in Van Braeckel et al. (2012), as well as earlier MONEOS reports. The ecotope map the result of the merger of two separate layers, being an fysiotopic and a geomorphologic layer. The maps of the lower Sea Scheldt, upper Sea Scheldt, Rupel and Durme were actualised in 2016. The geomorphologic layer is a polygon map that was actualized in 2016 using ARCGIS, based on 'false colour' imagery from the lower Sea Scheldt (source: nv De Vlaamse Waterweg) and 'true colour' orthoimagery from the upper Sea Scheldt, Rupel and Durme. Because the time at which the images were collected does not precisely match low tide, interpretation of the substrate in low lying areas has also been done based on 'true colour' orthoimagery from march 2017 (source: GDI-Vlaanderen AGIV), as well as field observations and digital height models.",
