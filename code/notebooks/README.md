# OIH Notebooks

## About

This section contains a collection of Notebooks related to the OIH project.
These are early documents and they and this documentation will expand.  These
notebooks are developed and run using the Jupyter Data Science notebooks server
(https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook).  The will likely run on
Google Colab or Binder but additional installs may be required.   We will
attempt to document all requirements in the notebooks and the instructions.
