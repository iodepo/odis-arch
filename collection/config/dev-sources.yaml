# Development config file for ODIS nodes, that drives the Dagster pipeline
# to update the ODIS graph.  Other important notes about this config file:
#  - sorted alphabetically by 'name' parameter
#  - no need to use quotes. Use the single-quoted style (') if characters 
#    such as " and \ are being used inside the string to avoid escaping them
#  - pid: should point to the ODISCat 'view' if available, such as https://catalogue.odis.org/view/689
#         or if not, use format: https://oceaninfohub.org/.well-known/org/[name]
#  - url: point to sitemap or sitegraph
#  - changefreq: how often sitemap is updated
#  - dateadded: YYYY-MM-DD (the date that JSON-LD became available, but not
#               necessarily when it was included in the ODIS graph)
#  - headless: false if JSON-LD is embedded in page, or if sitegraph
#  - cron: how often to harvest the endpoint, defaults to weekly (on Sunday)
#  - active: ready to include in ODIS
#  - if a parameter has no value, leave blank (with no quotes)
# To validate at commandline: execute the following (if the file contains valid 
# yaml, it will return nothing) :
#    python -c 'import yaml, sys; yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin)' < sources.yaml
