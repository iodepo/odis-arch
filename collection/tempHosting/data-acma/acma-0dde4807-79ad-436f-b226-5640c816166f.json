    "description": "An island or isle is any any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, cays or keys. An island in a river or an island in a lake may be called an holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago. An island may still be described as such despite the presence of an artificial land bridge, or delta islands. Some places may even retain \"island\" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a wide land bridge. Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the mainland by a man-made canal, it is generally not considered an island. There are Six (6) pronounced Islands in the nation.",
