    "description": "Along with the core information on state and changes in forests, FRA 2000 is reporting on various ecological aspects of forests. Forest resources information will be reported by ecological zone, which will contribute to understanding the implications of forest change on (ecosystem) biological diversity and carbon-cycling processes. The 2000 global ecological zone map has been developed, building upon the FRA 1990 experience for the tropics and extending the coverage to include the temperate and boreal forests. A globally consistent classification has been adopted, based on the Koppen-Trewartha climate system in combination with natural vegetation characteristics. A total of 19 global ecological zones have been defined and mapped, ranging from the evergreen tropical rainforest zone to the boreal tundra woodland zone. A main principle of delineating the global ecological zones involved the aggregation or matching of available regional ecological or potential vegetation maps into the global framework.",
