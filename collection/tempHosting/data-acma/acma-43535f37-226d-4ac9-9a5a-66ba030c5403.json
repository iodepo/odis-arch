    "description": "Reef development is more limited on the islandâ€™s eastern coast, where in many places the shore and continental shelf are sheer. But the northeast, with its somewhat more convoluted aspect, supports coral communities at places like Toamasina and the Masoala Peninsula. Divers off Nosy Boraha--also known as Sainte Marie Island--can explore diverse reef communities, searching for grouper, barracuda, skates and other undersea denizens. Masoala National Park, comprised of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, features 164 species of reef-building corals and hundreds of kinds of associated animals, from sea turtles to sharks. Besides the vibrant reefs, the park protects important mangrove forests.",
