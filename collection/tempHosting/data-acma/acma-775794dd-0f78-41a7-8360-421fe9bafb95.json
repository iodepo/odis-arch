    "description": "The dataset represents the Madagascar regional distribution of warm water coral reefs. It has been created from multiple sources and supercedes the dataset used in the World Atlas of Coral Reefs (2001), although some aspects of this product still originate from that datasource.  This global coral reef dataset should be seen an 'interim' global product .It has been compiled from a number of data sources which have been merged together by UNEP-WCMC and the WorldFish Center in collaboration with WRI and TNC. The Approximate % coverage of data sources are as follows - Millennium Coral Reefs (Unvalidated) 50%- Millennium Coral Reefs (Validated) 30 %- Other sources 20%",
