    "description": "Madagascar’s west coast contains the greatest diversity of coral reefs. Here, a great “river” of seawater, the Agulhas Current, warms the shallows over a broad continental shelf, and a variety of reef types--including fringing, barrier and bank reefs--have developed. The world’s third-largest network of coral reefs lies off the southwestern coast. Called the Toliara or Tulear reef system, this tract spans close to 200 miles between the vicinity of the Mangoky River mouth to the north and the community of Androka to the south. According to the \"World Atlas of Coral Reefs,\" the Tulear reefs sport at least 130 species of stony coral and 700 kinds of fish. Andavadoaka-area reefs, only recently systematically surveyed, are also species-rich. But, like many coral systems worldwide, they have suffered mightily from bleaching, wherein coral polyps lose their symbiotic algae. In 2006, National Geographic reported that a survey of the reefs off the southwestern coast by the groups Blue Ventures, and the Wildlife Conservation Society suggested that some corals there might be resistant to bleaching.",
