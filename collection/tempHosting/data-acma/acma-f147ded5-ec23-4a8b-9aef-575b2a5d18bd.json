    "description": "Submarine Canyon, any of a class of narrow, steep-sided valleys that originate on the continental shelf and cut into continental slopes and continental rises of the oceans. They are rare on continental margins that have extremely steep continental slopes or escarpments. Submarine canyons are so called because they resemble canyons made by rivers on land. A submarine canyon is a sharply angled valley on the floor of the ocean of the continental incline. Submarine canyons act as conduits to bring sand-sized sediments from the continental margins to the deep sea. During lowstands of sea level, rivers empty directly into the heads of many Atlantic canyons. Sand and mud are carried down these systems, many times bypassing the slope-rise system to be carried directly out onto the abyssal plains of the ocean floor.",
