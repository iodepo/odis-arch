    "description": "Data on Marine Protected Areas (including their Take or No-Take status) was obtained from the Offshore\nMarine Protected Area project (Sink et al. 2010), while data on terrestrial protected areas which have a\ncoastal element was obtained from the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy dataset (DEAT\nSANBI, 2009) . Terrestrial protected areas were assigned to the \"Take\" category unless their entire\ncoastline was a \"No-take\" MPA. The Biodiversity Target of 20% was used in the evaluation, as is the\nstandard practice for all NBA 2010 assessments. In addition a supplementary \"No-take\" target was derived\nfrom the marine offshore protected area targets contained in the National Protected Areas Expansion\nStrategy (DEAT SANBI, 2009), which includes targets for marine protection at 20% (i.e. the same as the\nbiodiversity target) , and a \"No-take\" target of 15% of the habitat. The level of protection of each ecosystem\nwas evaluated against the 20% biodiversity target, and then \"No-take\" areas were evaluated against the\n15% target. The protection levels were defined according to the following categories. Ecosystems were\nclassified as \"Not protected\" if there was no formal protection; as \"Hardly protected\" if under 5% of target\nwas met in protected areas; as \"Poorly protected\" if from 5% to just under 50% of biodiversity target is met\nin protected areas; as \"Moderately protected\" if from 50% to just under 100% of the Biodiversity target is\nmet in protected areas; and as \"Well protected\" if the biodiversity targets are fully met and the No-take\ntarget is met. Ecosystems where the biodiversity targets are fully met but where there is insufficient Notake\narea, were down-graded to a \"Moderately protected\" classification.",
