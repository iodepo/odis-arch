    "description": "Cutting of EEZ polygon based on breaks and depth strata determined at BCLME/BENEFIT workshop and through discussions with Pat Morant, Marek Ostrowski and Neville Sweijd ; 10 and 30 m depth lines based on IH data (ph_bathy_coast_li_an), but had to be added with info from GEBCO (ph_bathy_off_gr) for gaps. 70 m isobath was interpolated as offshore boundary for deep photic in northern Angola.  Slope breaks based on GEBCO data. For the file ph_biozo_sym_pol_an, the supratidal, intertidal, shallow and deep photic zones display a symbolic width and are not based on the real depth values for these zones (otherwise too small).",
