    "description": "The dataset represents the boundaries of the FAO Fishing Areas. This is the first release of this dataset. The dataset will be extended in the future with the polygons of the divisions and subdivisions of the fishing areas.For statistical purposes, 27 major fishing areas have been internationally established to date. These comprise eight major inland fishing areas covering the inland waters of the continents, and nineteen major marine fishing areas covering the waters of the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans, with their adjacent seas. The major fishing areas, inland and marine, are identified by their names and by two-digit codes",
