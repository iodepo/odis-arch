    "description": "ETOPO1 is a 1 arc-minute global relief model of Earth's surface that integrates land topography and ocean bathymetry. It was built from numerous global and regional data sets, and is available in \"Ice Surface\" (top of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets) and \"Bedrock\" (base of the ice sheets) versions. The relief for the rest of the world is the same in both versions. Shoreline, bathymetric, topographic, integrated bathymetricâ€“topographic, and bedrock digital datasets were obtained from several U.S. government agencies, international agencies and\nacademic institutions.",
