    "description": "Human transformation of coastline including cities, settlements, harbours in the BCLME (Angola, Namibia, South Africa).\nAngola: Transformation identified based on different sources on coastline data.  Note that only human transformation was considered.  Natural transformation such as erosion that was not clearly influenced by human activities was not included. Sources: Google Earth images 2007, Topographic maps 1:100,000 and Landsat images 2000.\nNamibia: Mainly orthophotos 2001 - 2002 made by Airborne Laser Solutions for Ministry of Lands & Resettlement (MLR), Digitising : GreenMap.\nSouth Africa: Data adopted from NSBA project, updated for the BCLME project by Taniia Strauss, using aerial & satellite data, February to September 2006, some changes made by Vera De Cauwer, GreenMap Consultants CC (eg addition of Lambert's Bay and Ngqura harbours).",
