    "description": "Biozones for the Namibian EEZ representing by actual respectively symbolic areas\nMethod of data acquisition: Cutting of EEZ polygon based on breaks and depth strata determined at BCLME/BENEFIT workshop ; 10 and 30 m depth lines based on SAN data (ph_bathy_coast_li_na), but had to be added with info from GEBCO (ph_bathy_off_gr) and own grid from hydro acoustic (Survey General) and SAN points for southern part of Namibian waters. Slope breaks based on GEBCO data. For the file ph_biozo_sym_pol_na, the supratidal, intertidal, shallow and deep photic zones display a symbolic width and are not based on the real depth values for these zones (otherwise too small).",
