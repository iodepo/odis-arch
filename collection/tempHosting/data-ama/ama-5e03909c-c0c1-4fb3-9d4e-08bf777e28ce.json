Where possible, boundaries were created from co-ordinates provided in the gazettes. Where landmarks were not specific co-ordinates, other shapefiles were used (e.g. farms shapefile, rivers shapefile, 1:250 000 maps etc.)\nSource: Atlas of Namibia (Ministry of Environment and Tourism) and World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA).",
