    "description": "Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are relatively large areas of ocean space of approximately 200,000 km² or greater, adjacent to the continents in coastal waters where primary productivity is generally higher than in open ocean areas. The LMEs produce about 80% of the annual world’s marine fisheries catch. Globally they are centers of coastal ocean pollution and nutrient overenrichment, habitat degradation (e.g. sea grasses, corals, mangroves), overfishing, biodiversity loss, and climate change effects.",
