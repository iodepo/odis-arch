    "description": "The  Skeleton Coast Park was proclaimed in its current size in 1973.\nThe data for this file was taken from the Atlas of Namibia, which was created using government gazettes. Where possible, boundaries were created from co-ordinates provided in the gazettes. Where landmarks were not specific co-ordinates, other shapefiles were used (e.g. farms shapefile, rivers shapefile, 1:250 000 maps etc.).\nAtlas data for protected areas was refined with diagram for Cape Cross (Survey General), coastline and IUCN information.",
