    "description": "The sightings of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in Namibian waters between 1971 and 1999 are shown. The shapefile for the sightings off Southern Right Whales off the coast of Namibia was created by buffering the coastline at 3km and intersecting the buffer line with the sightings provided as latitudes only. The distance of 3km was used because the source claimed that all sightings occurred within 3km of the coast",
