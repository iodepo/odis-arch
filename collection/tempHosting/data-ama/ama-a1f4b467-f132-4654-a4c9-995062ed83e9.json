    "description": "Intertidal coastal habitat types of the BCLME (Angola, Namibia, South Africa).\nAngola: Coastal types from orthorectified Landsat images with additional info from Google images.  Coastal type could not always be determined from the satellite images, especially were Google did not have high resolution images.  Pebble beaches were not distinguished. Wave exposure based on wind/swell info and a study of Howes, Harper & Owens (ilmbwww.gov.bc.ca/rics/ pubs/coastal/pysshore).  Quick discussion of results with Pat Morant.\nNamibia: Digitised by GreenMap Consultants from colour orthophotos Survey General +  identification of pebble beaches : shape file of Geological Survey of Namibia (based on expert input of Dr O'Toole and Bronwyn Currie). Texture digitised from colour orthophotos Survey General ; wave exposure based on information Rod Braby, weather info and a study of Howes, Harper & Owens (ilmbwww.gov.bc.ca/rics/ pubs/coastal/pysshore).\nSouth Africa: Data compiled for NSBA using expert input from Prof. George Branch & Dr. Jean Harris expressed on coastline digitised off 1:50,000 topomaps. Data adopted from NSBA project, updated for the BCLME project by Taniia Strauss, February to May 2006, small changes made by Vera De Cauwer, GreenMap Consultants CC.",
