    "description": "Biozones for the Angolan and Namibian EEZ representing by actual respectively symbolic areas.\nMethod of data acquisition Angola:Cutting of EEZ polygon based on breaks and depth strata determined at BCLME/BENEFIT workshop and through discussions with Pat Morant, Marek Ostrowski and Neville Sweijd; 10 and 30 m depth lines based on IH data, but had to be added with info from GEBCO for gaps. 70 m isobath was interpolated as offshore boundary for deep photic in northern Angola.  Slope breaks based on GEBCO data. The supratidal, intertidal, shallow and deep photic zones display a symbolic width and are not based on the real depth values for these zones (otherwise too small).\nMethod of data acquisition Namibia: Cutting of EEZ polygon based on breaks and depth strata determined at BCLME/BENEFIT workshop ; 10 and 30 m depth lines based on SAN data, but had to be added with info from GEBCO  and own grid from hydro acoustic (Survey General) and SAN points for southern part of Namibian waters. Slope breaks based on GEBCO data. The supratidal, intertidal, shallow and deep photic zones display a symbolic width and are not based on the real depth values for these zones (otherwise too small).",
