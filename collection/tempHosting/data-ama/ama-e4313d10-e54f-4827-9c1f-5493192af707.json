    "description": "As part of the core objective of Soil Research Institute, Accra's EISD project was to develop a soil information system for environmental planning and decision support in Ghana.  This produced a national soil database based on 1:250,000 scale maps.  All existing analog soil maps were digitized and edge-matched to create a seamless soil map of Ghana.",
