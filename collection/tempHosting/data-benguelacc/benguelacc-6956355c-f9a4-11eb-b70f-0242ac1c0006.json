    "description": "Coastal land transformation maps generated by Vera De Cauwer as part of the BCLME Physical mapping project were the base data. The mapping was based on orthophotos, satellite imagery and topographic maps, and gives an indication of any human transformation in the coastal area, e.g. roads, mines or settlements. The layer is now very dated especially considering that rapid urban expansion has occurred over the last few years in certain areas, such as between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. In addition, the original data layer was based on datasets that were already dated at the time and in many cases incomplete. The data were reclassified and presented as a coastal development score of 0-1, per 5' grid cell.",
