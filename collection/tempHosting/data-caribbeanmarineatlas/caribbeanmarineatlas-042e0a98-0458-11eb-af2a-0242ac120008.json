    "description": "The bacteriological water quality and physio–chemical parameters were measured along the popular Chaguaramas Peninsula in western Trinidad, to evaluate bathing beach water quality and identify possible sources of sewage contamination. Three bacterial indicators were chosen for this study (Escherichia coli, enterococci and faecal coliform), and were analysed by membrane filtration in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) protocol. The physio–chemical parameters collected were pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, and rainfall. Samples were collected at six nearshore locations during the months of July/August, 2016 (wet season) and January/February, 2017 (dry season).",
