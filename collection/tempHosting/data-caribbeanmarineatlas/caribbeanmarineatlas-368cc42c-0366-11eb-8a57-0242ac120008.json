    "description": "The Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (hereafter referred to as spiny lobster or lobster), is distributed in the subtropical western Atlantic from Bermuda and the east coast of the USA from North Carolina, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, including the entire Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, from shallow waters to depths up to 100 m.\n\nCombining this layer with a land file will provide an approximate representation of distribution.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to define the different lobster stock units due to their long larval phase across wide areas of open ocean before settling in a suitable habitat, doing so is necessary if this internationally important fishery is to be managed effectively, however dividing line between stocks are not has defined in reality as they appear in the shapefile. Classification of the stock structure improves with additional research.",
