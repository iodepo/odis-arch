    "description": "Sistema Delta Estuarino del Río Magdalena, Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta\n\nSistema Delta Estuarino del Río Magdalena, Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta. 18/06/98; Magdalena; 400,000 ha; 10°45'N 074°29'W. The site is a coastal estuarine system with 20 lagoons of varying salinity, with several rivers running through the area and extensive zones of mangroves. The site is important for its mangrove ecosystem, which is the largest on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. It also serves as habitat and winter breeding ground for several bird species, has at least two endemic bird species, and is also a spawning ground for many fish species. Part of the site is state-owned, while a large area is privately-owned and commercial fishing is important for the community around it. Shellfish and crayfish are also harvested in the area, while the higher zones are used for agriculture. Ecotourism is being developed in the protected area. Ramsar site no. 951. Most recent RIS information: 1998.",
