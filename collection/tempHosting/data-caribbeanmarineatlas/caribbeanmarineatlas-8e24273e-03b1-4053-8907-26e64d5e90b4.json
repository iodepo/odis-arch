    "description": "WWFâ€™s Global 200 project analyzed global patterns of biodiversity to identify a set of the Earth's terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecoregions that harbor exceptional biodiversity and are representative of its ecosystems. This process yielded 238 ecoregions--the Global 200--comprised of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine priority ecoregions. Effective conservation in these ecoregions would help conserve the most outstanding and representative habitats for biodiversity on this planet.",
