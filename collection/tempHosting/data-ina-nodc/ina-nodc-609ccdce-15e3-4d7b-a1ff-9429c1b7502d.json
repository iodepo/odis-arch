    "description": "UOR (Undulating Ocean Recorded Data) dataset observed from UOR measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, and pressure. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 26.407 stations data and more than 4.043.047 samples data from November 14, 1992. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia, France and United States had made observations using UOR measurement.",
