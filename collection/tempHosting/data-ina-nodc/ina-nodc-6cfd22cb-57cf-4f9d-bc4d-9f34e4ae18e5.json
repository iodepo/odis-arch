    "description": "MRB (Moored Buoy Data) dataset observed from moored buoy measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature and salinity. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 171.894 stations data and more than 1.973.441 samples data from February 18, 1990. It was identified that several countries involved including Japan, Taiwan and United States had made observations using moored buoy measurement.",
