    "description": "SUR (Surface Only Data) dataset observed from surface instrument measurements. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity, pH, chlorophyll, alkalinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, CO2 warming, CO2 atmosphere and air pressure. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 619 stations data and more than 52.350 samples data from June 27, 1961. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, New Caledonia and United States had made observations using surface instrument measurements.",
