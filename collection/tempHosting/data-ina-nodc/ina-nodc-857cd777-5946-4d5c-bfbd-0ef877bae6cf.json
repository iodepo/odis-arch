    "description": "PFL (Profiling Floats Data) dataset observed from floater measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, pH, transmissivity and pressure. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 177.341 stations data and more than 51.224.486 samples data from March 4, 1995. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia, China, France, Great Britain, India, Japan, Korea, and United States had made observations using floater measurement.",
