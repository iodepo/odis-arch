    "description": "CTD (Conductivity Temperature Depth) dataset observed from CTD measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll, transmissivity and pressure. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 29.195 stations data and more than 19.074.761 samples data from June 27, 1961. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Panama, Russia, Taiwan and United States had made observations using CTD measurement.",
