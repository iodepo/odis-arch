    "description": "Kenya continental shelf layer is a GIS vector polygon showing the extended area of  Kenya continental shelf (btn 0 -200-meter depth contour) in a square kilometer.  This layer was derived from the General Bathymetric Chart of the OCean (GEBCO) 2019 through spatial extraction of pixel with a depth range between 0 meters-200meters. All spatial analysis and delineation of the final product were performed by CORDIO East Africa.",
