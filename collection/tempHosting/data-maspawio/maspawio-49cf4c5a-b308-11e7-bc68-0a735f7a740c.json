It shows general warmer than usual waters of the WIO  with the highest peak observed in the North eastern waters  around Seychelles. \nThis data was derived using raster calculator in ArcGIS 10.3 to derive the 2016 seasonal average, and subtracted from this the long-term seasonal average from the 2003-2016 data series.",
