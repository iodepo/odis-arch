The data was derived from Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) archive as single tiles that were seamlessly combined and clipped to the NMC region extent.\nThe coverage has also been styled to illustrate elevation up-to 100 meter thereby depicting low lying areas of the NMC.\\\nJarvis, A., H.I.
