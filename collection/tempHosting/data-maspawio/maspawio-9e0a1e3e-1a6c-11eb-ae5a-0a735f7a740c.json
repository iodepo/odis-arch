    "description": "This policy insight illustrates the challenges faced by many coastal cities in tackling the\ninterwoven issues of demographic growth, climate change and waste management. With\na focus on Mombasa, Kenya, it looks at how the priority climate hazards of flooding and\nsea-level rise interact with water and solid waste, and focuses on the potential for naturebased solutions. Treating grey water through constructed wetlands, revegetating urban\nzones to optimise the benefits residents receive from natural spaces, and investing in\nmangrove fringes for coastal protection, water treatment and blue carbon finance provide\nopportunities for multiple co-benefits to urban residents. The latest recommendations for\nrestoring nature down to the smallest scale (to 1km2 areas), opportunities for generating\nincome for informal groups, and the recognised value of building social capital at\nneighbourhood levels may provide a golden opportunity to reinforce ecological, economic\nand social resilience in responding to the multiple hazards facing East African coastal cities.",
