    "description": "This major research study into sorcery accusation-related violence in Papua New Guinea found that over the past 20 years, an average of 72 people per year are victims of sorcery accusation-related violence of which an average of 30 people per year have been killed. This is likely to significantly under-represent the true number of incidents, as this number only reflects those reported in the media and in court reports.  \n\nThe paper describes the characteristics of the incidents, victms and perpetrators and records both the state and non-state responses to the violence. \n\nThe study indicates that the major trigger for sorcery accusations is a death in the family or community.  The study also indicates that when local leaders, such as human rights defenders, church leaders or police intervene, violence can be averted.",
