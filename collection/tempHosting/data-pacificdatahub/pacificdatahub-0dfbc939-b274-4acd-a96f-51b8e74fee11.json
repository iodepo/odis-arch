    "description": "The 84th Extraordinary Outreach Session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in Samoa ( 'CRC84') was the first time any of the United Nations Treaty Bodies have held a regional session to review multiple countries outside of Geneva or New York. The historic and innovative nature of this meeting mean it is prudent to document the experience and lessons learned, in order to inform future thinking around regional or sub-regional sessions.\nAuthored by SPC RRRT, this review attempts to capture this through a consultative process and by drawing on a range of sources.",
