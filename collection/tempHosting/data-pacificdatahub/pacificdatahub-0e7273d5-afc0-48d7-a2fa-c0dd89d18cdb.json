    "description": "The Chuuk Women’s Council, through its Tongen Inepwineu Counselling Center (TICC) counselling service, carried out its first 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign, in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and not having their president present in-country. The global campaign starts annually on 25 November with International Day for the Elimination of Gender-Based Violence and ends 10 December on Human Rights Day. CWC carried out several outreach programs to communities and schools, was part of the state leadership summit, launched a COVID-19 ‘safety at home’ video animation, supported a family planning workshop, and other activities.",
