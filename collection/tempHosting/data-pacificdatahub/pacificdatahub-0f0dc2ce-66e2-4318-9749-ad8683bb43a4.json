    "description": "This report contains highlights for the Pacific Women in Papua New Guinea program, including the conclusion from the mid-term evaluation that the program is on track to achieve its objectives, and that the program uses evidence to inform policy and practice. \n\nOther highlights include: \n\n- Since July 2017, 944 women and girls have accessed support services, including counselling, case management, health or justice services and emergency repatriation and reintegration support in the case of extreme violence. This includes 66 women and girls who have been relocated due to extreme violence. \n\n- Participants in the Family Teams Highlands and the CARE Coffee Industry Support Project evaluations said that by taking a family business approach to their farms, they had increased productivity and decision-making and workloads within families was more equitable. \n\n- Research conducted in Papua New Guinea and published this year found that in order to achieve real change to womenâ€™s economic situation, we need to work with men and challenge the gender norms that increase work burdens and potentially place women at greater risk of harm.",
