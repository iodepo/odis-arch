    "description": "The Pacific Young Women’s Leadership Strategy was published in 2011 by the World YWCA with support from the  Pacific Leadership Program. The strategy is presented under five themes: \n\n- Safe. \n\n- Respected. \n\n- Included. \n\n- Connected. \n\n- Skilled. \nThese themes were developed after analysing responses from over 250 young women who participated in interactive consultations across six Pacific Island countries.\n \nThe strategy presents a comprehensive agenda for organisations and governments wishing to develop the leadership potential of young women to achieve social, political and economic change across the Pacific region.",
