    "description": "A SOPAC project funded by the European Union and the Australian Government with the assistance of the Tuvalu Government ,involved a De 719e Raytheon precision echo sounder used to profile the seabed. Bathymetry data created from this was used as post-dredging data which was analyzed against 2 pre-dredging bathymetry data sets surveyed previously  to assess changes in the lagoon sea floor. Current measurements of the lagoon water combined with the plume data, was used to determine the factors influencing plume direction and dissipation.To assess changes in the lagoon sea floor topography, determine sediment stability and to assess the physical environment parameters within the pilot dredging site.The pilot dredge site extends 1.5 km                     lagoonward of the shoreline to the 25 misobath and 300 m north and south of a northwest line.",
