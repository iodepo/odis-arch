    "description": "The Marshall Island Exclusive Economic Zone was measured from the low water line of the seaward side of the normal baseline (coast), the low-water line of the seaward side of the reef fringing the coast or bounding any lagoon waters adjacent to any part of that coast. Marzone delimitation software was used to generate territorial sea limit using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) reference datum as stipulated under the Republic of the Marshall Islands Maritime Zone Declaration Act 2016.\r\n\r\nIn the EEZ a coastal State has control of all economic resources including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and any pollution of those resources. However, it cannot prohibit passage or loitering above, on, or under the surface of the sea that is in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of the UN Convention, within that portion of its exclusive economic zone beyond its territorial sea.",
