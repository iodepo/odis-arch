    "description": "This report provides details of CTD data collected in 2005 and 2006 in the equatorial Pacific Ocean during cruises to service the TAO/TRITON array, a network of deep ocean moored buoys deployed to support ENSO research and forecasting. The TAO/TRITON array, completed in 1994, consists of approximately 70 deep ocean moorings within 8 degrees of the equator spanning the Pacific Basin from 95◦W to 137◦E. Moorings west of 165◦E are maintained by the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). High quality oceanographic and surface meteorological data are recorded and reported in real time using the Argos satellite data telemetry system. These data are used to improve understanding, modeling, and prediction of the global interannual climate fluctuations associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomena in the tropical Pacific Ocean.",
