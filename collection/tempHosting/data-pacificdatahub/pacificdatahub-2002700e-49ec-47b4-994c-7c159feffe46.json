    "description": "The UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office, in consultation with partners, identified two main challenges facing Pacific organisations and networks to scale up efforts to end violence against women in the Pacific region. These were: \n\n- Limited access to financial resources, and related needs for skills building in project, financial and organisational management. \n\n- Knowledge and capacity needed to strengthen rights based approaches for survivors of violence against women. \n\nUN Women created the Pacific Regional Facility Fund in Support of Organisations and Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women (Pacific Regional EVAW Facility Fund) in 2009 to provide grants and capacity building to support EVAW initiatives led by governments and civil society organisations in Pacific Region. The project provides regional and country-based technical assistance for grant recipients, and a forum for regional south-south exchanges to share experiences, challenges and solutions.",
