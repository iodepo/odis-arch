    "description": "High-resolution bathymetric mapping survey was carried out for Kiribati Islands around Abaiang, Tarawa, Abemama, Banaba and Onotoa. The survey was carried out over a period of six weeks in September and October 2005, resulting in the acquisition of over 900 km of multibeam echo sounder (MBES) data. Resultant data compilation was used to produce bathymetry charts including Abaiang bathymetry chart and is available for download from its appropriate link under Distribution Info. This work was initiated by the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the European Union (EU) Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.Charts provides information about water depths around the island. The bathymetric maps should also give descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain , vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features . They can also serve as the basic tool for scientific , engineering , marine geophysical and environment studies as well as marine and coastal resource management.Abaiang located at 1 degree 80' South and 172 degree 96' E is a coral Atoll ,comprising 6 islets in the Northern Kiribati with a total area of 16 square kilometers.  Approximately 2km offshore on all sides and a maximum depth coverage of 1500m of the area was covered by the multibeam echo sounding system survey (MBES).",
