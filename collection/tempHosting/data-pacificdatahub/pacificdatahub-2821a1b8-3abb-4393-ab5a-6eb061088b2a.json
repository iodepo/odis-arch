    "description": "The Samoa Education Sector Plan (ESP) brings together the forward plans of the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture (MESC), the Samoa Qualifications Authority (SQA) and the National University of Samoa (NUS), together with the arrangements for implementing and monitoring these plans. It strengthens Samoaâ€™s Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), involving all stakeholders in tackling the developmental needs of the education sector in Samoa. Education is key to the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS), including the need to improve employment prospects1 and reduce the scarcity of skilled labour that constrains private sector growth.",
