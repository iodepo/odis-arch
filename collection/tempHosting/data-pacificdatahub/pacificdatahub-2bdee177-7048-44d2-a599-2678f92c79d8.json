    "description": "Nauru Contiguous Zone was calculated from its territorial sea baseline using a special maritime boundaries delimitation software called MarZone. The Proclamation Sea Boundaries Act 1997 states the geographical coordinates are expressed using World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). \r\n\r\nA state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing \"infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea\". This will typically be 12 nautical miles (22 km; 14 mi) wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's contiguous zone.",
