    "description": "Marshall Islands Police Department officers received training by Women United Together in Marshall Islands (WUTMI) to better respond to and prevent violence against women, with Pacific Women support. The training focused on gender, violence against women, human rights and legislation and was remotely delivered. ‘Police, as first responders and community activists, are essential to stopping violence and helping our nation return to its culture of peaceful families, but we need to train and support police to help make a violence free RMI a reality,’ said WUTMI Executive Director, Daisy Alik-Momotaro. ‘This training is also very timely, as in recent months during the COVID-19 response period, there has been a surge of sexual violence and substance abuse which target women and girls within their communities,” she said.",
