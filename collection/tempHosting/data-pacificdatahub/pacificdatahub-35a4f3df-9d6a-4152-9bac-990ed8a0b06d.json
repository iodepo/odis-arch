    "description": "This toolkit presents an approach to assessing the cost impacts of gender-based violence on businesses in Papua New Guinea. \n\nThe costing methodology and tools consist of four core steps:  \n\n- A framing of gender-based violence definitions and scope. \n\n- Partnership development and collection of background data. \n\n- Fieldwork and feedback. \n\n- A cost-calculation and presentation phase.\n\n Each component consists of several methodological subcategories that depend on the broader implementation environment, the business sector context and the type and capacity of the actors undertaking the costing activity. The latter issues are addressed after discussion of the core tool, and a case study provides a brief overview of the costing process in action.",
