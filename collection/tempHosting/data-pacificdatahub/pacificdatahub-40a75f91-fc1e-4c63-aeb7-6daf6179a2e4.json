    "description": "Part of the broader Pacific women’s movement, the We Rise Coalition advocates for gender equality. Members FWRM, femLINKpacific and IWDA were joined by new members Talitha Project in Tonga, Brown Girl Woke in Samoa, Sista in Vanuatu and Voice for Change in Papua New Guinea in 2020. Existing gender inequalities are exacerbated during a crisis such as COVID-19, resulting in women and girls facing even higher rates of sexual and gender-based violence coupled with a greatly increased unpaid care work burden and less access to health services. Solidarity and inclusivity, and the power of coalitions, have been central to efforts among women’s groups advocating for gender-inclusive responses to the pandemic.",
