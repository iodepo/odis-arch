It is the first crisis support centre for women survivors of violence in the Federated States of Micronesia and provides free, confidential and non-judgmental counselling and trained “safe counsellors” who provide counselling and support to survivors of domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment and child sexual abuse. To develop its crisis counselling project, Chuuk Women’s Council received funding and extensive on-going technical support from the Australian Government through Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development.",
