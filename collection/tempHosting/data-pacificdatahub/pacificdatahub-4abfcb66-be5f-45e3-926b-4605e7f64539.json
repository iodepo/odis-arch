    "description": "The findings from this study about community views about women in politics and leadership more generally provide important information about current attitudes, how these vary across the population in Fiji, and where change is happening. \n\nThe repor contains information to inform future action to support increased representation of women in politics and a baseline against which the success of such efforts can be assessed. The study draws attention to the gender bias that lies at the heart of why women are under-represented in government and the necessity for definitive action to support women’s political participation in order to better reflect the public’s desire for more gender balanced political representation.",
