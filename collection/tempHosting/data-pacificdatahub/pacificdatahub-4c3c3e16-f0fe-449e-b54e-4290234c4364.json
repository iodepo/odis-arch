    "description": "The Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) roundtable convened July 2021 generated critical discussions around gender and agriculture in the Pacific. Key presentations centered on the Fiji 2020 Agriculture Census – Volume III: Gender Analysis Report by the Ministry of Agriculture; Gender Equality, Disability and Social Inclusion (GEDSI) Analysis of the Root Crop Sector by the PHAMA Plus program; Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Analysis in the Organic Space by the Pacific Organic and Ethical Trade Community (POETCom) Pacific Community (SPC). The online, quarterly WEE roundtable meetings were hosted by the Pacific Women Support Unit. In 2021, two virtual meetings were held, the first focussing on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on women and marginalised groups. The roundtable brings together key-stakeholders working on WEE projects across the Pacific, to contribute to the body of knowledge about what women’s economic empowerment looks like in the region and how it can best be supported. The convenings are developed to support partners keen to increase their knowledge and further improve their WEE projects to better empower women in the Pacific.",
