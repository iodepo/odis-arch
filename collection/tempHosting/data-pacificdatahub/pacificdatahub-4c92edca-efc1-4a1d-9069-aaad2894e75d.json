The inner boundary of the exclusive economic zone of each island or atoll is the seaward boundary of the contiguous zone, and the outer boundary is a line, every point of which is 200 nautical miles seaward of the nearest point on the baseline as defined unless otherwise limited by international law or agreement. \r\n\r\nPalau has deposited the coordinates for the outer limits of its exclusive economic zone with the UN as published in M.Z.N.62.2008 (Maritime Zone Notification) 24 June 2008.\r\n\r\nThe national government shall have exclusive management, conservation, and regulatory authority over all living resources within the exclusive economic zone to the full extent recognized by international law. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/PLW_2003_PNC.pdf\r\nhttps://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/MAPS/PLW_MZN62_2008_00188_p2.jpg \r\n",
