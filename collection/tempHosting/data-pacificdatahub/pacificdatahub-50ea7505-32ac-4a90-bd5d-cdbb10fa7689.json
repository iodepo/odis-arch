    "description": "This webinar aimed to identify measures for a gender-aware and feminist response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls in the Pacific. It also sought to broaden a shared understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on women and marginalised groups in the Pacific, including on changes in women’s paid and unpaid labour. \nThrough a 10-year commitment, Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development (Pacific Women) connects more than 170 gender equality initiatives supported by Australia and implemented by over 160 partners across 14 Pacific Island countries. \nProviding technical, knowledge sharing and convening support to the portfolio of partners is Pacific Women’s Support Unit, working to improve the long-term impact of gender equality projects in the Pacific.\nThis webinar is the first in a series of webinars being planned by a regional women’s economic empowerment (WEE) roundtable group that meets quarterly, hosted by the Pacific Women Support Unit. The WEE roundtable brings together stakeholders to contribute to the body of knowledge about what women’s economic empowerment looks like in the Pacific and how women’s economic empowerment can best be supported in the region.",
