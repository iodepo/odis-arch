    "description": "This report provides findings from a study conducted with men in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea on their use of violence against women. The study questioned 10,000 men in nine sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea. Men were asked about their use and experiences of violence, gendered attitudes and practices, childhood, sexuality, family life and health. \n\nThe study found that, overall, nearly half of the men interviewed reported using physical and/or sexual violence against a female partner, ranging from 26% to 80% across the sites studied. Nearly a quarter of men interviewed reported perpetrating rape against a woman or girl, ranging from 10% to 62% across the sites.",
