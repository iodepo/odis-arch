    "description": "The report gives an overview of the cruise of R/V Kilo Moana, a US flagged science vessel belonging to the Office of Navel Research and operated by the University of Hawaii. The cruise took place during 2007 and was organised around a US National Science Foundation funded study of the diversity and activity of nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs). The core project focused on characterization of the diazotroph community using molecular tools in combination with a suite of geochemical methods designed to quantify the contribution of diazotrophy to the local and regional nitrogen budget.",
