    "description": "This research shows that the young women who are part of the Young Women's Parliamentary Group are working to advance women’s participation and leadership in a range of ways in Solomon Islands. They are not exclusively or even primarily focused on increasing women’s representation within the National Parliament. The young women’s intuition that they can achieve more outside or on the edge of the political realm than within it, provides an interesting perspective on how formal politics is viewed by young women in Pacific nations. While not giving up on the idea of getting women into parliament, the young women see a singular focus on this goal as potentially detrimental to their overall aim of advancing women’s leadership and activism more generally.",
