    "description": "Positive gender transformative change is not only possible, it is happening in Papua New Guinea.\nThis is detailed in the ‘What Works for Gender Transformative Approaches in Papua New Guinea' report.\nPacific Women is one of the largest global commitments to gender equality. It aims to improve opportunities for the political, economic and social advancement of Pacific women. It is supported by the Australian Government through the Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership. Since it began in 2012, it has committed $116.84 million to initiatives that support women’s empowerment in Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.\nAs a result of Pacific Women’s long-term commitment to partners’ efforts, gender transformative change is happening in Papua New Guinea. Women and men in their family, communities and workplaces, are changing the way they behave to reduce the harms to women and girls and to strengthen their families, communities and workplaces.\nPacific Women partners have identified eight elements that have been key to achieving gender transformation in #PapuaNewGuinea, detailed in the ‘What Works for Gender Transformative Approaches (GETA) in Papua New Guinea' report.",
