    "description": "This is a 2013 supplement to the 700 page 1998 text ‘Law for Pacific Women: A Legal Rights Handbook (1998) by Imrana Jalal.’ The Handbook and the Supplement examine legislation, court decisions, common law, legal structures and legal practices in the Pacific Islands through a human rights, feminist lens. The Handbook and Supplement are designed to be used together. The Supplement covers the laws and legal processes relating to: \n\n- Violence against women. \n\n- Family law.  \n\n- Social and economic issues. \n\n- Women as criminal defendants. \n\nThe Supplement also reflects on lessons learned. Despite some good progress, the Supplement shows that there is much more work to be done before gender justice is fully achieved.",
