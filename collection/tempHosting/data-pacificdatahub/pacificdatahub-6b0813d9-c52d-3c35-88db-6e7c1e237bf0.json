    "description": "SEA Semester is a study-abroad programme operated in conjunction with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute that offers students the chance to combine an academic challenge with the adventure of an extended research cruise under sail. The 25 March to 2 May, 2005, SEA cruise of SSV Robert C. Seamans departed from Honolulu, Hawaii, sailed south through Palmyra Atoll and the Line Islands (Kiribati) before returning, 5 weeks later, to Honolulu. A wide range of physical, chemical and biological variables were measured during the cruise. Full details are given in the report, available for download under 'Online resources'.",
