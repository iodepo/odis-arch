    "description": "\nTonga is an archipelago composed of 172\nislands spread across a combined land and\nsea area of 720,000km \n2 \n. According to the 2011\ncensus, Tonga had a population of 103,252 people\nspread across 36 of the 172 islands. A population\nscattered so widely across such a large area can\npose logistical problems for efforts to facilitate and\nfinance disaster response.\n\nIn January 2014, Tropical Cyclone Ian caused\nwidespread damage and destruction on the\nislands of Ha’apai and Vava’u.\n\nApproximately\n1,094 buildings in Ha’apai were either destroyed\nor damaged, and some 2,335 people sought\nshelter in evacuation centers. There were reports of\nsignificant damage to houses, infrastructure, and\nagriculture across 18 villages located on the islands\nof Ha’apai, including Uiha, Uoleva, Lifuka, Foa,\nHa’ano, and Mo’unga’one. Total ground-up loss for\nthis event was estimated at T$90 million (US$50.3\nmillion), of which T$20.5 million (US$11.5 million)\nwas attributable to emergency loss (PCRAFI 2014).\n This report presents for consideration a number of\noptions for improving current measures for disaster\nrisk financing and insurances:\n\n(a) develop an overarching disaster risk financing\nstrategy aligned to existing processes;\n\n(b) develop an operations \nmanual detailing the\nprocesses required to facilitate swift postdisaster\nbudget mobilization and execution;\nand\n\n(c) develop an insurance program for key public\nassets.",
