    "description": "This brief provides examples of gender transformative changes achieved by initiatives in Papua New Guinea. It describes practical, proven approaches for gender-transformative change and highlights the importance of: \n\n- Program design explicit in its aim to reshape gender norms and power relations. \n\n- Working in partnership with organisations and community groups to create change. \n\n- Drawing on community strengths, customs and practices. \n\n- Clearly aligning activities to support government policy commitments and strengthen government systems. \n\nThese approaches have been developed through Pacific Women’s partners’ efforts. Such approaches seek to overcome the harmful norms and structures that reinforce gender inequalities in Papua New Guinea, underpinned by global experience. \n\nThe brief highlights how gender transformation can be achieved by reinforcing changes at multiple levels, while ensuring a commitment to robust monitoring and shared learning.",
