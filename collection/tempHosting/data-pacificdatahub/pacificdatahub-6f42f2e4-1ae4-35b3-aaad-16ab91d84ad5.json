    "description": "This project is sponsored by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and managed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia and SOPAC.\nThe poster and brochure contained in this metadata entry provides information on the background information of the phases of the SPSLCMP project, objectives of the project, roles of the individual project partners and there connection to other major projects and produced as part of awareness programs of the project.The first two phases of the project (from July 1991 to December 2000) established sea level/meteorological monitoring stations at eleven sites, one each in Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Samoa. Another station was established in December 2001 in the Federated States of Micronesia during the project's third phase (January 2001 to December 2006). The third phase also involved installation of continuous global positioning systems (CGPS) at many of these locations in order to monitor vertical movements of the islands upon which the sea level monitoring stations are based.",
