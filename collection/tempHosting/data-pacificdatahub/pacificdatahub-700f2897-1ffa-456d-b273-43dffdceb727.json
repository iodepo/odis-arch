    "description": "Only two women have been elected to parliament (currently made up of 15 members) in Tuvalu since independence in 1978. With some exceptions, since the 1997 Falekaupule Act the final decision-making body (the Falekaupule) on many of Tuvalu’s eight inhabited islands has been dominated by male members, namely elders, matais (heads of each clan) and chiefs.  \n\nBecause national politics remains heavily island based, the design of temporary special measures becomes crucial.  Options being considered are:\n\n- Provide an additional seat for women from each of Tuvalu’s eight islands. \n\n- Add two seats for women to the existing legislature elected from across the entire country. \n\n- Add two seats for women to the existing legislature but restrict them to Funafuti, the capital. \n\nThe paper notes that without widespread popular support, any proposed system for temporary special measures is likely to flounder due to the sensitivity and complexity of gender issues in Tuvalu.",
