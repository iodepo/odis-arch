    "description": "Part 2 of the Tuvalu Maritime Zones Act 2012 states that the contiguous zone comprises those areas of the sea that are beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, having as their outer limits a line measured seaward from the baseline every point of which is distant 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of that baseline.\r\n\r\nWhere an archipelagic baseline is declared, the outer limits of the contiguous zone are a line measured seaward from that archipelagic baseline, every point of which is distant 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of that archipelagic baseline.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Declaration of Contiguous Zone 2012 made under the MZA 2012 contains the geographical coordinate with reference to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The MZA of Tuvalu clearly illustrates in a map the contiguous zone of Tuvalu.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/MAPS/TUV_MZN146_2019_EZ_ill.jpg https://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/tuv_maritime_zones_act_2012_1.pdf",
