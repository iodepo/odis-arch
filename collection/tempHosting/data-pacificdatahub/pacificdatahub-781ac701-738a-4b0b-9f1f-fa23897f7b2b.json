    "description": "The Provision of the Interpretation Act 1971 defines the “Nauruan territorial waters\" as:\r\n\r\nThat area of water, and the waters and subsoil beneath it, enclosed by a line every part of which is at a distance\r\nof twelve miles from the nearest point of the outer edge of the reef surrounding the Island of Nauru which is exposed at low tide and, where there is an opening in the reef, from a straight line across the outer edge of that opening.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of 12 August 1997 provides the geographical coordinates for Nauru’s territorial seas as declared under Sea Boundaries Act 1997. The geographical coordinates are expressed in terms of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84), which is a geocentric reference ellipsoid having a major (equatorial) radius of 6,378.137 metres and a flattening of 1/298.257 223 563.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/NRU_1997_Proclamation.pdf\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/NRU_1971_Act.pdf\r\n",
