    "description": "More than 100 women and men from all parts of Papua New Guinea, the Pacific and globally were able to connect through various online platforms over five intensive days in August and share invaluable research, knowledge and resources in their work to empower women. The Zoom meeting was broadcast from Port Moresby to four provincial venues that participants could visit to watch the workshop ‘live’ in Buka, Goroka, Lae and Wewak. Partners viewing from the four provinces commented how this year’s workshop provided an opportunity for them to participate as they had always wanted to with previous Annual Learning Workshops. Implementing partners, development organisations and representatives of the Government of Papua New Guinea contributed to the forum focused on increasing women in leadership, supporting women’s economic empowerment and strengthening violence prevention and response in Papua New Guinea. The annual workshop was part of Pacific Women in Papua New Guinea’s efforts to enhance knowledge and evidence to inform policy and practice.",
