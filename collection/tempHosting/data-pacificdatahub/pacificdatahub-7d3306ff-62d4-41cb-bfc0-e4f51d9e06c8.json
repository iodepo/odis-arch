    "description": "The central theme of CSW65, held in March 2021, was women’s participation and decision-making in public life and the elimination of violence. As Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, Tuvalu represented the forum’s Pacific Island countries. Tuvalu’s Minister for Health, Social Welfare and Gender Affairs, Honourable Isaia stated that the empowerment of Pacific women and girls was critical to achieving sustainable development and the resilience of Pacific nations, adding there was a long way to go before we can see women’s full participation in decision-making in the Pacific. Hon. Taape called the rate of violence against women shameful, saying Pacific Island countries needed to work together to bring significant changes and recognise women and girls’ real value.",
