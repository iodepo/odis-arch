    "description": "The Marshall Islands Contiguous Zone was measured from the low water line of the seaward side of the normal baseline (coast), low-water line of the seaward side of the reef fringing the coast and bounding any lagoon waters adjacent to any part of that coast. MarZone delimitation software was used to generate the Contiguous zone using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) reference datum as stipulated under the Republic of the Marshall Islands Maritime Zones Declaration Act 2016.\r\n\r\nA state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing \"infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea\". This will typically be 12 nautical miles (22 km; 14 mi) wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's contiguous zone.",
