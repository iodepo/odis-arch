    "description": "The impacts of COVID-19 are not gender-neutral. Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by crises compared with men and boys, and so both women and men need to be included in response planning as leaders and decision makers. Women are key to an effective response. To encourage gender inclusive COVID-19 responses, Pacific Women’s Support Unit supported 164 partners across its portfolio of 171 gender equality initiatives in 14 Pacific Islands, funded through the Australian Government. Government, civil society, private sector, development and other partners working on gender equality and women’s empowerment in the Pacific drove incredible COVID-19 initiatives and advocacy approaches.",
