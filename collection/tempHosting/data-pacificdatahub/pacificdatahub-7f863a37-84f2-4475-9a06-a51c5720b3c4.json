    "description": "In the lead up to Tongan elections on November 30, 2021, a workshop was held to assist current and potential women candidates to become more effective candidates who are better able to develop impactful campaigns and influence voters about the benefits women offer as leaders. In mid-November 2021, Tonga had only two women members in parliament, one elected and one appointed. \nThe workshop provided a platform for the women to learn from past experiences of women parliamentarians, while sharing their ideas, concerns and questions around election processes and campaigning. It was hosted by Fi-e-Fi-a â€˜a Fafine Tonga (FFFT) Women Coalition and supported by the Balance of Power (#BOP) program.",
