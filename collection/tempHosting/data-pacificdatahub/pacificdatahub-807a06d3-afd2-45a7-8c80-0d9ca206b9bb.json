    "description": "The Pacific Guide to Statistical Indicators for Human Rights Reporting is the first such document of its kind on human rights reporting under the core human rights treaties in the Pacific.\nIt proposes a set of indicators that are contextually relevant and meaningful for the region, acknowledging the unique challenges and opportunities that Pacific Island countries experience in data collection, national institutions and resources.\nThe guide is meant to assist coordinating bodies within Pacific Island governments responsible for preparing initial and periodic reports on the countryâ€™s progress on implementation of ratified treaties, as well as those overseeing the implementation of national human rights action plans. The guide will also help national statistics offices to better understand how the statistical data they collect, analyse and provide feeds into human rights reporting.",
