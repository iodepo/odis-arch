    "description": "This pamphlet identifies ten principles of gender equality theology, using biblical quotes to support each statement: \n\n- Being human is a birth-right. \n\n- Created in God’s image and likeness. \n\n- Incarnation affirms our common humanity. \n\n- The Gospel affirms human equality. \n\n- Abundant life (Gutpela sindaun). \n\n- God’s kingdom as servanthood. \n\n- Mutuality in Christian relationships and marriage. \n\n- The gifting by the Holy Spirit is inclusive. \n\n- Empowering the disempowered. \n\n- Sex and gender roles.",
