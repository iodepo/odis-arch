    "description": "This is a pre-recorded musical performance by Mia Kami for the ‘Pacific girls and COVID-19’ webinar. The song was performed live.\r\nThe webinar promoted girls’ involvement as essential in the recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak.\r\nThe song ‘Dear Society’ is for Ms Kami’s sister, reflecting on the damaging expectations that society has of women, and why it’s important for us to support each other. It was composed in honour of her older sister who passed on at the age of 15 after undergoing multiple surgeries on her face to remove a tumour.\r\nMs Kami is a young Tongan woman studying Law and Politics at the University of the South Pacific in Suva. She is passionate about gender equality, indigenous sovereignty and decolonisation; all of which she channels into music and song writing.",
