    "description": "Women United Together in Marshall Island’s (WUTMI) believe that greater action is needed to intensify and strengthen partnerships to better address the issue of sexual violence and harassment. This was highlighted by Executive Director, Daisy Alik-Momotaro at the Orange Day march through the streets of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands in September 2020. She said 'Today sets a milestone in the RMI in our fight against sexual violence and harassment against our young adolescents and women of all ages’ With the support of Pacific Women, WUTMI established RMI’s first counselling service Weto in Mour in 2016, which continues to raise awareness about violence against women and improve the referral network and services provided for survivors.",
