    "description": "Prominent figures in Tuvalu took the lead during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence in 2020, speaking out against violence in a national media campaign. The campaign set the tone for a range of events coordinated by the Gender Affairs Department (GAD) in partnership with other stakeholders in Tuvalu, featuring: the Prime Minister, His Excellency Kausea Natano; Attorney General, Eselealofa Apinelu; and Minister for Health, Social Welfare and Gender Affairs, Isaia Taape. ‘Domestic violence is not a private matter or a family issue but a crime that is against the law, it affects us all because we are all connected with each other,’ His Excellency Natano said.",
