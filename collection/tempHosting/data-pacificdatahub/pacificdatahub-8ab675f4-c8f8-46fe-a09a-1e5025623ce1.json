    "description": "Gender inequality in Papua New Guinea is widespread, and achievements to date have been poor. Papua New Guinea ranks 123 out of 156 countries on the Gender-related Development Index and 145 out of 177 countries on the Gender Empowerment Measure. Papua New Guinea is 119 in a ranking of 121 countries for women’s political participation. Under the Constitution, every Papua New Guinean has the right, and shall be given a reasonable opportunity, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, either directly or through freely chosen representatives and to vote and to hold public office and to exercise public functions. \n\nThis concept note sets out a proposal for a consultation that will develop a joint strategy and action plan for increasing women’s participation in local government, in the lead up to national representation. \n\nIt is proposed that this will be delivered through two main streams:\n1. Increase electoral success (with focus on the upcoming 2012 local level government elections). \n2. Promote and support the implementation of the Organic Law and nominate either one (for Urban) or two (for Rural) women to be part of the legislative arm of the LLG (Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments – Clause 29 (c) and (d)).",
