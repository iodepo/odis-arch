    "description": "This record holds the multibeam bathymetry chart of Nan Mandol and Matalanim harbour in Pohnpei Island.  Work was carried out over a 14-day period in June/July 2006 and involved multibeam bathymetric mapping, single-channel seismic profiling, current metering and CTD (conductivity temperature depth) profiling.\nDetailed bathymetric mapping was completed in the following areas of the State of Pohnpei: 1) Kolonia Harbour and Lagoon; 2) Sokehs Passage and Lagoon; 3) Pohnpei Passage; 4) Matalanim Harbour; 5) Nan Madol Lagoon; 6) Rontiki Harbour; and 7) offshore bathymetry of Pohnpei Island.\nThe offshore bathymetry chart of Pohnpei is available for download from the distribution section of this metadata record with appropriate permission from the Secretariat. Resultant datasets in XYZ format and related reports are available as a separate metadata record.\nThis work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU project, Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States.Data from the survey will be used to support activities in fisheries, mineral exploration, coastal management, and geo-hazard studies.",
