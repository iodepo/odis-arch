    "description": "Violence against children and women is a problem in many parts of Papua New Guinea. Parenting programs have shown promise in preventing violence and neglect of children, as well as improving child health and educational outcomes in high-income countries. However, there are very few parenting programs that are culturally appropriate, evidence-based and affordable for low and middle-income countries such as Papua New Guinea.\n\nUNICEF, in partnership with the Catholic Church Archdiocese of Madang, Chimbu and Mt Hagen and the Menzies School of Health Research in Australia, worked with communities in Papua New Guinea to improve parenting practices and support the wellbeing of children through piloting a Parenting for Child Development program in targeted communities. The evaluation of the pilot program found that, since the program started, there had been significant improvement in family wellbeing and a reduction in the occurrence of violence in the family.",
