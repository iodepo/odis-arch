    "description": "This Thematic Brief provides information and analysis about climate change issues affecting women and girls in the Pacific Islands region. It has been developed by the Support Unit of Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development (Pacific Women). The three key messages provide background to women and climate change issues in the Pacific. They demonstrate the importance of recognising and supporting women’s leadership and decision-making in addressing climate change in the Pacific region. This includes during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the socio-economic impacts of climate change and the pandemic intersect to negatively affect the most marginalised, such as those already burdened by climate change.4\n1. Women’s knowledge and skills in managing climate change need to be recognised and supported.\n2. Women’s leadership and voice in policy setting and decision making for a climate-resilient future need to be recognised and supported.\n3. Women are more exposed and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nWomen are key to addressing climate change in the Pacific, a region containing six out of the 15 countries most at risk of disasters in the world.5 Weather-related events such as cyclones, floods, coastal inundation and droughts are increasing in intensity or frequency across the region.",
