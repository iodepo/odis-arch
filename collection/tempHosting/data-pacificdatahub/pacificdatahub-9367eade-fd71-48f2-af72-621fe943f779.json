    "description": "Fiji has one of the highest rates of domestic and sexual violence in the world with almost two-thirds of the countryâ€™s women experiencing domestic or sexual violence during their lifetime. This has serious negative impacts on individuals, families, communities and workplaces. For the three companies included in this study, the high rates of domestic and sexual violence translate into lost staff time and reduced productivity that is equivalent to almost 10 days of lost work per employee each year.\n\nThis study includes three private sector companies, collectively employing 1,701 employees as of December 2018. The companies were selected to ensure sector diversity and based on their commitment to supporting staff affected by domestic and sexual violence. A total of 563 staff completed the staff survey, representing 33 per cent of all employees. The study also included individual and group interviews involving 43 women and 43 men in both supervisory and non-supervisory roles.",
