    "description": "This chart was compiled from high-resolution bathymetry mapping survey of the seabed surrounding the island of Niue was used to produce bathymetry charts of Niue at a scale of 1:50 000, and a more detailed chart of Alofi Bay at a scale of 1:10 000. These new bathymetric maps give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features, and serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.The chart of Alofi bay at scale 1 to 50 000 is available for download from its appropriate link under Distribution Info. This work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU project \"Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States\".To provide a comprehensive GIS database containing information relating to three sectors of interests: aggregates for construction, water and sanitation, and risks and hazards.Sounding datum is 5.573 m below BM1, 3.165 m below BM2, and 19.174 m below Niue fundamental station, Tomb Point. Sounding datum was established by HMNZS Monwai (1994).Backdrop image of Niue is a rectified IKONOS satellite image.",
