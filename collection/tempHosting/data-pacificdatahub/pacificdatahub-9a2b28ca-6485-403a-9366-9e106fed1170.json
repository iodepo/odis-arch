    "description": "The Maritime Zones Act 2013 states that the exclusive economic zone of Niue comprises those areas of the sea, seabed and subsoil that are beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea having as their outer limits a line measured seaward from the baseline, every point of which line is not more than 200 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.\r\n\r\nThe Exclusive Economic Zone Outer Limit Notice 2013, No. 2013/2D states the relevant coordinates for the EEZ of Niue as well as outlining the various treaties that it shares with neighbouring states. Most important is that it highlights the geodetic framework in which the geographic coordinate is determined by reference to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). It also shows charts that illustrates the lines described under the schedule of coordinates.\r\n\r\n(1)Within the exclusive economic zone, Niue has sovereign rights- (a) for the purposes of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of (i)the seabed; (ii)the subsoil under the seabed, and ( iii)the waters over the seabed, and\r\n\r\n(b) with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents and winds.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/niu_exclusive_economic_zone_outer_limit_notice2013.pdf https://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/niu_maritime_zones_act_2013.pdf",
