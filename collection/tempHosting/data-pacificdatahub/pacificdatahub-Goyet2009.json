    "description": "We present results of the CO2/carbonate system from the BIOSOPE cruise in the Eastern South Pacific Ocean, in an area not sampled previously. In particular, we present estimates of the anthropogenic carbon (C\\textgreaterTrOCAant) distribution in the upper 1000 m of this region using the TrOCA method. The highest concentrations of CTrOCAant found around 13° S, 132° W and 32° S, 91° W, are higher than 80 $μ$mol.kg−1 and 70 $μ$mol.kg−1, respectively. The lowest concentrations are observed below 800 m depth (≤2 $μ$mol.kg−1) and within the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), mainly around 140° W (\\textless11 $μ$mol.kg−1). As a result of the anthropogenic carbon penetration there has been decrease in pH by over 0.1 on an average in the upper 200 m. This work further improves our understanding on the penetration of anthropogenic carbon in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.",
