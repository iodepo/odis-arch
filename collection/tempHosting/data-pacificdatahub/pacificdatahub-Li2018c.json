    "description": "Several studies have demonstrated that shellfish calcification rate has been impacted by ocean acidification. However, the carbonate system variables responsible for regulating calcification rate are controversial. To distinguish the key variables, we manipulated a seawater carbonate system by regulating seawater pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Calcification rates of juvenile blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) were measured in different carbonate systems. Our results demonstrated that neither [HCOˉ3], DIC, or pH ([H+]) were determining factors for the shellfish calcification rate of blue mussel or Zhikong scallop. However, a significant correlation was detected between calcification rate and DIC/[H+] and [CO32ˉ] in both species.",
