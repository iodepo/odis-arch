    "description": "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provided funds for the upgrade of two roads in Vanuatu.  These were the Efate Ring Road and the Santo East Coast Road.  Both these roads were unpaved (coral) roads and were sealed with a double surface dressing in 2009/10.  The length of road sealed in Efate was 92.5 km and 57.2 km in Santo.  An HDM-4 analysis was conducted to examine:\n\ni) The economic viability of upgrading the two roads\nii) The future performance of the roads",
