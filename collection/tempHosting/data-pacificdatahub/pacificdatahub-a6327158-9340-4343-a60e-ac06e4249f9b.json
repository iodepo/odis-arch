    "description": "The first regional ‘Supervision Skills for Health and Social Services Professionals' training aimed to support crisis centre counsellors and caseworkers in delivering services to women and children survivors of violence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It brought together more than 20 participants from crisis centres in small island states, joined by government nominees, from Federated States of Micronesia (Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap states), Kiribati, Nauru, Republic of Marshall Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu. The event built on gender-based violence (GBV) counsellors’ existing partnerships with Pacific Women, through its Pacific-based advisers, collaborating to: strengthen counselling and training skills, develop telephone counselling training, establish a Community of Practice to share lessons across crisis centres, improve Counselling Code of Conducts, and to create improved, confidential client databases.",
