The line has been determined by using the nearest points of the baselines from which the territorial sea of each country is measured. In the case of France, the baseline is drawn in conformity with the Acts of 24th December 1971 and 28th December 1976. In the case of Fiji, the baseline is the archipelagic baseline drawn in accordance with the Fiji Marine Spaces Act of 15th December 1977.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/FRA-FJI1990EZ.PDF\r\n\r\n",
