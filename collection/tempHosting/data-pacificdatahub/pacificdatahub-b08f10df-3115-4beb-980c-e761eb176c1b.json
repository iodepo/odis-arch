    "description": "Findings from the study include: \n\n- Girls in Kiribati lack knowledge about menstruation and reproductive health as they transition into adolescence and adulthood. \n\n- Poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) contributes to girls being unable to manage their menstruation in Kiribati schools. \n\n- It is often considered taboo for men and boys to talk about menstruation or interact with  menstruating girls and women. \n\n- Strong beliefs about menstruation in Kiribati culture can have a very positive effect on girls. However, some behavioural restrictions have potentially harmful outcomes. \n\n- Girls in Kiribati schools find it difficult to manage their menstrual pain. \n\n- Key members of the school leadership community also lack knowledge about menstrual health and hygiene, most notably parents and teachers. \n\nRecommendations for school leaders include: \n\n- Ensuring the school toilets are safe, secure, private and hygienic. Encouraging teachers to talk about menstruation and female health with students. \n\n- Acting as role models. \n\n- Ensuring easy access for girls to sanitary pads and pain relief. \n\n- Disciplining bad behaviours. \n\n- Starting a conversation about behavioural restrictions for menstruating girls.",
