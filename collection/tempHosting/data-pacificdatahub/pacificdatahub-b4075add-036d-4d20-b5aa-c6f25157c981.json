    "description": "Findings from participatory action research undertaken with family and sexual violence service providers, advocates, businesses, and their employees in Papua New Guinea strongly indicate that workplace strategies should be modified to reflect cultural and other contextual specificities. In particular, workplace strategies should reflect local understandings about what constitutes family and sexual violence; who may perpetrate it and who may be victimised by family and sexual violence; and what supports are available to victims of family and sexual violence. \n\nWhile the supports examined are necessarily culturally and contextually specific to Papua New Guinea, they have subsequently provided important insights relevant for workplace responses in other developing and industrialised countries, thereby extending the evidence base of possible workplace strategies generally.",
