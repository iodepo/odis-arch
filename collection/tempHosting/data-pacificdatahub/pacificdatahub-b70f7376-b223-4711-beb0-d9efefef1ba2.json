    "description": "Niue's Territorial Sea Baseline was derived using the IKONOS satellite imagery taken in 2004 and Horizontal Datum used was the World Geodetic Datum 1984 (WGS 84) as stipulated under Section 12 of the Maritime Zones Act 2013.\r\n\r\nNiue's Territorial Sea Baseline is categorised as a normal baseline. Under the United National Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), normal baseline can be drawn around low tide elevation which are defined as naturally formed areas of land surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide, provided they are wholly or partially within 12 nautical miles of the coast. \r\n",
