    "description": "This trainer’s handbook sets out five half-day trainings in Family Business Management Training relevant to rural settings. The topics are: \n\n- Exploring our household. \n\n- Exploring how we work together. \n\n- Managing money and coffee production. \n•Decision making and household budgeting. \n\n- Summary and planning for change. \nIt provides clear guidelines for trainers on activity objectives, key learning points and how to conduct each of the set daily activities.  \n\nThis trainer’s handbook was developed as part of the Coffee Industry Support Project, which aims to improve the economic and social wellbeing of women coffee farmers in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The coffee project works with coffee exporters and cooperatives to improve the services they provide to coffee farmers, so that they are inclusive of women and address the social constraints to coffee production. These social constraints include families lacking relevant business and financial management skills, women not accessing extension services, and families not currently working together effectively to maximise productivity and quality. \n\nThe project’s Family Business Management Training assists small-holder coffee farming families to overcome social barriers and cultural norms that inhibit them from developing their coffee farming business and maximising on working together effectively.",
