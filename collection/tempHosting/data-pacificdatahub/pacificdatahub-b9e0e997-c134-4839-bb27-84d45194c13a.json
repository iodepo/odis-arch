    "description": "This booklet highlights some of the work of Australia’s aid program to support an end to all forms of violence against women and girls, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. This includes providing services for women who have been affected by violence, programs that improve access to justice for survivors and help women rebuild their lives, education to change attitudes towards violence, and engaging men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence from occurring in the first place. \n\nEnding violence against women and girls is one of the three priorities in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Strategy.  This strategy guides the government’s foreign policy, economic diplomacy, development and corporate work on gender equality. Its three priorities are:  \n\n- Enhancing women’s voice in decision making, leadership and peace-building. \n\n- Promoting women’s economic empowerment. \n\n- Ending violence against women and girls. Australia has zero tolerance for violence against women. \n\nEliminating violence against women is a priority of the Australian Government. Australia is committed to supporting and partnering with other countries in this area through its foreign policy and aid program.",
