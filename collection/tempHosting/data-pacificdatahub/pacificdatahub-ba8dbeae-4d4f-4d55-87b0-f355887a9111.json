    "description": "Twenty Federated States of Micronesia  health workers and assistants completed training by Chuuk Women's Council's Tongen Inepwineu Counseling Center for 'Gender, Violence Against Women, Human Rights, Psychological First Aid and Frontline Support' in July 2021. The training focused on FSM health assistants and increasing their knowledge about the many aspects of support needed for survivors of violence against women - beyond medical assistance to include support to recover and seek long term assistance. The Tongen Inepwineu Counseling Center staff trained alongside the women and men health assistant trainees from the neighboring islands of Chuuk on how to provide better support to women and girl survivors of violence. For health assistants, this would pave the way for health services in rural locations to provide more comprehensive, necessary services for survivors. It would support their work as first responders in close collaboration with Ticc Gbv to ensure better support to survivors. Altogether, they learned how to properly handle referrals to ensure women and girl survivors receive all the help they need to recover from the violence.",
