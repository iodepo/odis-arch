    "description": "The Pacific Girl regional discussion: Girls Agency and the Pacific Girl Journey was held in June 2021. Adolescent girls and young women involved in the six initiatives supported by the Pacific Girl program across six Pacific Island countries participated in the online panel discussion, along with members of the Regional Learning Network coordinated by the Pacific Girl program. The convening was an opportunity to reflect with adolescent girls who had been participating in Pacific Girl programming at national and regional level. The purpose of the reflection was to: explore the experiences of adolescent girls participating in the Pacific Girl regional design and inception workshops to inform future engagement of adolescent girls in the Pacific Girl regional program.",
