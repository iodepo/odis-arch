    "description": "This report describes a high-resolution bathymetric mapping survey of the seabed in the nearshore areas of Gizo, Honiara, Marovo and Noro in the Solomon Islands, by the Pacific\nIslands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC).\nThe survey was carried out over a period of six weeks in June and July 2005, resulting in the acquisition of over 1535 km of multibeam echosounder (MBES) data. The resultant data was used to produce bathymetry charts of Gizo at 1:25 000, Honiara at 1:75 000, Marovo at 1:50 000, and Noro at 1:25 000 available for download from a separate metadata entry. The Survey report is available for download from the Distribution Info appropriate link. \nThis work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project (Task no.: NR 1.1.1).",
