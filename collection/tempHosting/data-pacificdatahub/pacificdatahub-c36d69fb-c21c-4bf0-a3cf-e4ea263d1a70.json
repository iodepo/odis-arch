    "description": "The research demonstrated that, in general, women’s increased involvement in community financial management and income generation has not necessarily led to a redistribution of caring work or other unpaid household and community responsibilities.\n\nThe findings also suggest that time-use, including\nroles within savings clubs, was a source of conflict\nwithin some households, particularly if it was seen as\nimpinging on women’s family responsibilities. This has\nimplications for women’s physical and mental wellbeing. Even in circumstances where men had reduced responsibility for earning income, there was little evidence of changes in their contribution to unpaid household and care work.",
