Launched during 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence in November 2020, the ‘Staying Safe at Home’ video addressed domestic and family violence which typically increases during times of crisis such as COVID-19. The Ministry of Home Affairs and its Ewak n Erateko Safe House took a lead role in developing the video, produced by Pacific Women in partnership with SPC.",
