    "description": "About 20 Chuuk State health assistant trainees completed a training course by Chuuk Women's Council's Tongen Inepwineu Counseling Center (Ticc Gbv) on 'Gender, Violence Against Women, Human Rights, Psychological First Aid and Frontline Support’ in July 2021. The training focused on increasing their knowledge about the many aspects of support needed for survivors of violence against women — beyond medical assistance to include support to recover and seek long term assistance. As a result, health assistants in rural locations will be able to provide more comprehensive, necessary services for survivors, including their work as first responders in close collaboration with Ticc Gbv to ensure better support to survivors through proper referral needed to recover from the violence.",
