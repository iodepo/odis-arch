    "description": "This toolkit is a starting point for community organisations to mainstream gender into their work. It provides a straightforward and practical framework for gender mainstreaming and a clear process for applying it within an organisation. The toolkit assumes that the reader will have a basic understanding of the concepts of gender and gender equality. Gender mainstreaming involves working through a checklist of different components and putting practical actions in place to achieve them. It requires organisations to make an honest assessment of the areas where they are performing well and where they need to do better. \n\nThis toolkit identifies five organisational dimensions, which are critical in effectively mainstreaming gender into community organisations. They are: \n\n- Leadership. \n\n- Culture. \n\n- Capacity. \n\n- Accountability. \n\n- Programs.  \n\nIt contains a gender mainstreaming score card to help assess an organisationâ€™s performance in gender mainstreaming.",
