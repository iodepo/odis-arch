Waters landward of the baseline, including the lagoons of atolls or islands, are internal waters. \r\n\r\nAnnex I to the Permanent Regulation on the Maritime Boundaries and Maritime Zones of the Federated States of Micronesia proclaims the geographical coordinates of the territorial sea baselines of the separate islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. \r\n\r\nThe sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia extends to its internal waters, archipelagic waters, and Territorial Sea, including sovereign rights over the living and nonliving resources in the Territorial Sea and internal waters and in the airspace above the Territorial Sea, archipelagic waters, and internal waters as well as the seabed and subsoil.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/Title18FSMCode.pdf",
