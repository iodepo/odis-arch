    :description "Excavating sponges are prominent bioeroders on coral reefs that in comparison to other benthic organisms may suffer less or may even benefit from warmer, more acidic and more eutrophic waters. Here, the photosymbiotic excavating sponge Cliona orientalis from the Great Barrier Reef was subjected to a prolonged simulation of both global and local environmental change: future seawater temperature, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (as for 2100 summer conditions under \"business-as-usual\" emissions), and diet supplementation with particulate organics. The individual and combined effects of the three factors on the bioerosion rates, metabolic oxygen and carbon flux, biomass change and survival of the sponge were monitored over the height of summer. Diet supplementation accelerated bioerosion rates. Acidification alone did not have a strong effect on total bioerosion or survival rates, yet it co-occurred with reduced heterotrophy. Warming above 30 °C (+2.7 °C above the local maximum monthly mean) caused extensive bleaching, lower bioerosion, and prevailing mortality, overriding the other factors and suggesting a strong metabolic dependence of the sponge on its resident symbionts. The growth, bioerosion capacity and likelihood of survival of C. orientalis and similar photosymbiotic excavating sponges could be substantially reduced rather than increased on end-of-the-century reefs under \"business-as-usual\" emission profiles." ;

    :description "Communities in Fiji rely on provisioning services from landscape resources such as agricultural and forestry-related production, and climate regulation determined by the mix of landscape resources across space. Accurate mapping and monitoring of patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at scales relevant to livelihood processes is important for informing landscape management, land use policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. A methodology developed collaboratively with landscape stakeholders to produce an inter-annual LULC map that addresses natural resource, agricultural, and forestry management use cases is presented here. Key requirements identified by stakeholders were that the LULC methodology was robust, relatively easy to reproduce, and could be applied to other Fijian landscapes with different dynamics. Using publicly available remotely sensed data and geospatial tools, we applied the LULC methodology for two locations in the Ba Catchment, Fiji. Field orientation and key validation data were collected using the QField open-source mobile GIS, and labelled training and accuracy assessment data were collected in Google Earth. Annual median multispectral surface reflectance and seasonal NDVI-based phenology metrics derived from Sentinel-2, and topographic variation from SRTM DEM provided the best discrimination between vegetation classes across the catchment from low-lying coastal areas to the highlands (> 1000 m ASL). A random forest model was trained and validated in Google Earth Engine to produce an inter-annual LULC map with a 10m spatial resolution. An important outcome from our work was the transfer of skills and building of local stakeholder capacity to continue to update the LULC map, and to expand the map to include other communities, catchments and forestry areas across Fiji. This capacity building included iterative stakeholder consultation, co-development of online training materials, workshops, and collaborative fieldwork." ;

    :description "Climate change is expected to exacerbate upwelling intensity and natural acidification in Eastern Boundaries Upwelling Systems (EBUS). Conducted between January-September 2015 in a nearshore site of the northern Humboldt Current System directly exposed to year-round upwelling episodes, this study was aimed at assessing the relationship between upwelling mediated pH-changes and functional traits of the numerically dominant planktonic copepod-grazer Acartia tonsa (Copepoda). Environmental temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, alkalinity, chlorophyll-a (Chl), copepod adult size, egg production (EP), and egg size and growth were assessed through 28 random oceanographic surveys. Agglomerative clustering and multidimensional scaling identified three main di-similitude nodes within temporal variability of abiotic and biotic variables: A) “upwelling”, B) “non-upwelling”, and C) “warm-acid” conditions. Nodes A and B represented typical features within the upwelling phenology, characterized by the transition from low temperature, oxygen, pH and Chl during upwelling to higher levels during non-upwelling conditions. However, well-oxygenated, saline and “warm-acid” node C seemed to be atypical for local climatology, suggesting the occurrence of a low frequency oceanographic perturbation. Multivariate (LDA and ANCOVA) analyses revealed upwelling through temperature, oxygen and pH were the main factors affecting variations in adult size and EP, and highlighted growth rates were significantly lower under node C. Likely buffering upwelling pH-reductions, phytoplankton biomass maintained copepod reproduction despite prevailing low temperature, oxygen and pH levels in the upwelling setting. Helping to better explain why this species is among the most recurrent ones in these variable yet productive upwelling areas, current findings also provide opportune cues on plankton responses under warm-acid conditions, which are expected to occur in productive EBUS as a consequence of climate perturbations.

    :description "Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are causing ocean acidification by reducing seawater pH and carbonate saturation levels. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that many larval and juvenile marine invertebrates are vulnerable to these changes in surface ocean chemistry, but challenges remain in predicting effects at community and ecosystem levels. We investigated the effect of ocean acidification on invertebrate recruitment at two coral reef CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea. Invertebrate communities differed significantly between 'reference' (median pH7.97, 8.00), 'high CO2' (median pH7.77, 7.79), and 'extreme CO2' (median pH7.32, 7.68) conditions at each reef. There were also significant reductions in calcifying taxa, copepods and amphipods as CO2 levels increased. The observed shifts in recruitment were comparable to those previously described in the Mediterranean, revealing an ecological mechanism by which shallow coastal systems are affected by near-future levels of ocean acidification." ;

    :description "Acidification of seawater owing to oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 originating from human activities such as burning of fossil fuels and land-use changes has raised serious concerns regarding its adverse effects on corals and calcifying communities. Here we demonstrate a net loss of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) material as a result of decreased calcification and increased carbonate dissolution from replicated subtropical coral reef communities (n=3) incubated in continuous-flow mesocosms subject to future seawater conditions. The calcifying community was dominated by the coral Montipora capitata. Daily average community calcification or Net Ecosystem Calcification (NEC=CaCO3 production – dissolution) was positive at 3.3 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 under ambient seawater pCO2 conditions as opposed to negative at −0.04 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 under seawater conditions of double the ambient pCO2. These experimental results provide support for the conclusion that some net calcifying communities could become subject to net dissolution in response to anthropogenic ocean acidification within this century. Nevertheless, individual corals remained healthy, actively calcified (albeit slower than at present rates), and deposited significant amounts of CaCO3 under the prevailing experimental seawater conditions of elevated pCO2.

    :description "Ocean acidification represents a key threat to coral reefs by reducing the calcification rate of the major reef framework builders.  In addition, acidification is likely to affect the important relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates, and on the productivity of this association.  However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of key reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming.  Here, we report on an eight-week study that compared the bleaching, productivity and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank flow-through experimental system, we manipulated CO2 levels to simulate doubling and 3- 4-fold increases (projection categories 4 and 6 of the IPCC) relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results demonstrated that acidification is a strong bleaching agent for corals and CCA, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal thresholds for bleaching.  Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate CO2 scenario under the warm conditions lead to an 30-50% increase in productivity in corals, whereas the high CO2 level lead to near-zero productivity. Productivity and calcification rates of CCA were more sensitive to acidification than those of corals, with high CO2 dosing leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that, if CO2- emission scenarios unfold as projected, sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.

    :description "Ocean acidification is a threat to marine ecosystems globally. In shallow-water systems, however, ocean acidification can be masked by benthic carbon fluxes, depending on community composition, seawater residence time, and the magnitude and balance of net community production (NCP) and calcification (NCC). Here, we examine how six benthic groups from a coral reef environment on Heron Reef (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) contribute to changes in the seawater aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$a). Results of flume studies using intact reef habitats (1.2 m by 0.4 m), showed a hierarchy of responses across groups, depending on CO2 level, time of day and water flow. At low CO2 (350–450 $μ$atm), macroalgae (Chnoospora implexa), turfs and sand elevated $Ømega$a of the flume water by around 0.10 to 1.20 h−1 – normalised to contributions from 1 m2 of benthos to a 1 m deep water column. The rate of $Ømega$a increase in these groups was doubled under acidification (560–700 $μ$atm) and high flow (35 compared to 8 cm s−1). In contrast, branching corals (Acropora aspera) increased $Ømega$a by 0.25 h−1 at ambient CO2 (350–450 $μ$atm) during the day, but reduced $Ømega$a under acidification and high flow. Nighttime changes in $Ømega$a by corals were highly negative (0.6–0.8 h−1) and exacerbated by acidification. Calcifying macroalgae (Halimeda spp.) raised $Ømega$a by day (by around 0.13 h−1), but lowered $Ømega$a by a similar or higher amount at night. Analyses of carbon flux contributions from benthic communities with four different compositions to the reef water carbon chemistry across Heron Reef flat and lagoon indicated that the net lowering of $Ømega$a by coral-dominated areas can to some extent be countered by long water-residence times in neighbouring areas dominated by turfs, macroalgae and carbonate sand.

    :description "Myora Springs is one of many groundwater discharge sites on North Stradbroke Island (Queensland, Australia). Here spring waters emerge from wetland forests to join Moreton Bay, mixing with seawater over seagrass meadows dominated by eelgrass, Zostera muelleri. We sought to determine how low pH / high CO2 conditions near the spring affect these plants and their interactions with the black rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens), a co-occurring grazer. In paired-choice feeding trials S. fuscescens preferentially consumed Z. muelleri shoots collected nearest to Myora Springs. Proximity to the spring did not significantly alter the carbon and nitrogen contents of seagrass tissues but did result in the extraordinary loss of soluble phenolics, including Folin-reactive phenolics, condensed tannins, and phenolic acids by ≥87%. Conversely, seagrass lignin contents were, in this and related experiments, unaffected or increased, suggesting a shift in secondary metabolism away from the production of soluble, but not insoluble, (poly)phenolics. We suggest that groundwater discharge sites such as Myora Springs, and other sites characterized by low pH, are likely to be popular feeding grounds for seagrass grazers seeking to reduce their exposure to soluble phenolics." ;

We used a newly developed deep-sea Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (dp-FOCE) system1 to evaluate the potential consequences of future ocean acidification on the feeding behavior of a deep-sea echinoid, the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus fragilis. The dp-FOCE system simulated future ocean acidification inside an experimental enclosure where observations of feeding behavior were performed. We measured the average movement (“speed”) of urchins as well as the time required (“foraging time”) for S. fragilis to approach its preferred food (giant kelp) in the dp-FOCE chamber (-0.46 pH units) and a Control chamber (ambient pH). Measurements were performed during each of 4 trials (days -2, 2, 24, 27 after CO2 injection) during the month-long period when groups of urchins were continuously exposed to low pH or Control conditions. Although urchin speed did not vary significant in relation to pH or time exposed, foraging time was significantly longer for urchins in the low-pH treatment. This first deep-sea FOCE experiment demonstrated the utility of the FOCE system approach and suggest that the chemosensory behavior of a deep-sea urchin may be impaired by ocean acidification. " ;

    :description "We tested the sensitivity of the vertical distributions and shell dissolution patterns of thecosome pteropods to spatial gradients associated with an eddy-associated front in the southern California Current System. The aragonite saturation horizon ($Ømega$arag = 1.0) shoaled from \\textgreater200 to \\textless75 m depth across the front. The vertical distribution of thecosome pteropods tracked these changes, with all 5 species showing reduced occurrence at depths below 100 m where waters were less saturated with respect to aragonite. Shell dissolution patterns of the numerically dominant thecosome Limacina helicina corresponded to the cross-frontal changes in $Ømega$arag saturation state. Severe shell dissolution (categorized here as Type II and Type III) was low in near-surface waters where $Ømega$arag \\textgreater 1.4, while peak dissolution occurred in depths where $Ømega$arag = 1.0 to 1.4. Vertical habitat compression and increased shell dissolution may be expected to accompany future shoaling of waters that are undersaturated with respect to aragonite. " ;

    :description "The pteropod Limacina helicina frequently experiences seasonal exposure to corrosive conditions ($Ømega$ar  \\textless 1) along the US West Coast and is recognized as one of the species most susceptible to ocean acidification (OA). Yet, little is known about their capacity to acclimatize to such conditions. We collected pteropods in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that differed in the severity of exposure to $Ømega$ar conditions in the natural environment. Combining field observations, high-CO2 perturbation experiment results, and retrospective ocean transport simulations, we investigated biological responses based on histories of magnitude and duration of exposure to $Ømega$ar \\textless 1. Our results suggest that both exposure magnitude and duration affect pteropod responses in the natural environment. However, observed declines in calcification performance and survival probability under high CO2 experimental conditions do not show acclimatization capacity or physiological tolerance related to history of exposure to corrosive conditions. Pteropods from the coastal CCE appear to be at or near the limit of their physiological capacity, and consequently, are already at extinction risk under projected acceleration of OA over the next 30 years. Our results demonstrate that $Ømega$ar exposure history largely determines pteropod response to experimental conditions and is essential to the interpretation of biological observations and experimental results." ;

    :description "Elevated pCO2 threatens coral reefs through impaired calcification. However, the extent to which elevated pCO2 affects the distribution of the pelagic larvae of scleractinian corals, and how this may be interpreted in the context of ocean acidification (OA), remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that elevated pCO2 affects one aspect of the behavior (i.e., motility) of brooded larvae from Pocillopora damicornis in Okinawa (Japan), and used UV-transparent tubes that were 68-cm long (45 mm ID) to incubate larvae on a shallow fringing reef. Replicate tubes were filled with seawater at ̃400 $μ$atm or \\̃1,000 $μ$atm pCO2, stocked with 50 larvae each, and incubated vertically for 12 h with their midpoints at 0.3-m (shallow) or 3.3-m (deep) depth over a reef at 4-m depth. Larval behavior was assayed through their position in the tubes, which was scored in situ every 4 h beginning at 08:00 h. Lipid content was measured at the end of the experiment as a potential driver of behavior through its effects on larval buoyancy. Larval position in the tubes varied between depths and time of day at \\~̃400 $μ$atm pCO2 and \\~1̃,000 $μ$atm pCO2. At \\~0̃0 $μ$atm, larvae moved toward the top (0.1-m) of shallow tubes throughout the day, but in the deep tubes they aggregated at the bottom of the tubes from 08:00 to 20:00 h. In contrast, larvae incubated at \\~0̃00 $μ$atm pCO2 aggregated at the bottom of shallow tubes at 08:00 and 20:00 h, however in the deep tubes they were found in the bottom throughout the day. As lipid content of the larvae declined 23–25% at \\~10̃0 vs. \\~40$̃μ$atm pCO2, loss of lipid may be a cause of modified larval behavior at high pCO2. If the pCO2-mediated changes in behavior and lipid content during this short experiment occur during longer exposures to high pCO2, our results suggest OA could alter the dispersal capacity of brooded coral larvae." ;

    :description "Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are causing decreased pH over vast expanses of the ocean. This decreasing pH may alter biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen via the microbial process of nitrification, a key process that couples these cycles in the ocean, but which is often sensitive to acidic conditions. Recent reports have indicated a decrease in oceanic nitrification rates under experimentally lowered pH. How the composition and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) assemblages respond to decreasing oceanic pH is unknown. We sampled microbes from 2 different acidification experiments and used a combination of qPCR and functional gene microarrays for the ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) to assess how acidification alters the structure of ammonia oxidizer assemblages. We show that despite widely different experimental conditions, acidification consistently altered the community composition of AOB by increasing the relative abundance of taxa related to the Nitrosomonas ureae clade. In one experiment, this increase was sufficient to cause an increase in the overall abundance of AOB. There were no systematic shifts in the community structure or abundance of AOA in either experiment. These different responses to acidification underscore the important role of microbial community structure in the resiliency of marine ecosystems. " ;

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA) is one of the main consequences of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), impacting key biological processes of marine organisms such as development, growth and immune response. However, there are scarce studies on the influence of OA on marine invertebrates' ability to cope with pathogens. This study evaluated the single and combined effects of OA and bacterial infection on the transcription expression of genes related to antioxidant system, antimicrobial peptides and pattern recognition receptors in the edible mussel Mytilus chilensis. Individuals of M. chilensis were exposed during 60 days at two concentrations of pCO2 (550 and 1200 $μ$atm) representing respectively current and future scenario of OA and were then injected with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Results evidenced an immunomodulation following the OA exposure with an up-regulation of C-type Lectin and Mytilin B and a down-regulation of Myticin A and PGRP. This immunomodulation pattern is partially counteracted after challenge with V. anguillarum with a down-regulation of the C-type lectin and Mytilin B and the up-regulation of Myticin A. In turn, these results evidence that pCO2-driven OA scenarios might triggers specific immune-related genes at early stages of infection, promoting the transcription of antimicrobial peptides and patterns recognition receptors. This study provides new evidence of how the immune response of bivalves is modulated by higher CO2 conditions in the ocean, as well one factor for the resilience of marine population upon global change scenarios." ;

    :description "This investigation reports, for the first time, results of CO2 system variables in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, located in the Mexican tropical Pacific. We quantified the post-Tehuano concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH (April 2013). These values were used to calculate pCO2, aragonite saturation ($Ømega$Ar), and air-sea CO2 fluxes (FCO2). The intense vertical stratification was found to contribute to the biogeochemical processes in surface waters (\\textless70 m). However, in post-Tehuano conditions, high pCO2 (∼1000 µatm) and DIC concentrations (2200 µmol kg−1), as well as low $Ømega$Ar (∼1.1) and pH (∼7.5), remain in surface waters for a few days after Tehuano winds have weakened. We identified four oceanographic areas: (a) a highly mixed region due to previous Tehuano events; (b) coastal upwelling in the western region; (c) mesoscale eddies; (d) a poleward surface coastal current. The first three promoted the influence of Subtropical Subsurface Water in the chemistry of surface waters, whereas the coastal current contributed to the horizontal advection of DIC. The calculated CO2 fluxes ranged from −2.3 mmol m−2 d−1 in areas with stratified waters to over 25 mmol m−2 d−1 for mixed areas. Positive values indicate an ocean-to-atmosphere flux. Our findings suggest that the Gulf of Tehuantepec is a major source of CO2 into the atmosphere." ;

    :description "Oceans worldwide are undergoing acidification due to the penetration of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere1,2,3,4. The rate of acidification generally diminishes with increasing depth. Yet, slowing down of the thermohaline circulation due to global warming could reduce the pH in the deep oceans, as more organic material would decompose with a longer residence time. To elucidate this process, a time-series study at a climatically sensitive region with sufficient duration and resolution is needed. Here we show that deep waters in the Sea of Japan are undergoing reduced ventilation, reducing the pH of seawater. As a result, the acidification rate near the bottom of the Sea of Japan is 27% higher than the rate at the surface, which is the same as that predicted assuming an air–sea CO2 equilibrium. This reduced ventilation may be due to global warming and, as an oceanic microcosm with its own deep- and bottom-water formations, the Sea of Japan provides an insight into how future warming might alter the deep-ocean acidification." ;

In this study, we examine the effects of predicted ocean acidification on carbon and nitrogen accumulation and amino acids (AA) contents in G. lemaneiformis under different temperature levels. The results showed that G. lemaneiformis exhibited higher growth rates under high temperature conditions than under low temperature conditions, regardless of CO2 levels. Moreover, compared with low temperature, the culture conditions of high temperature enhanced N accumulation in G. lemaneiformis, resulting in increased N and AA contents and lowered C/N ratios. While low temperature had no significant effects on the C and N acquisition, it would alter the N conversion and assimilation in this alga. It appeared that the effects resulted from ocean acidification on carbon and N accumulation were more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Additionally, the enhancement percentages of growth, as well as the decrease extent of C/N ratios, resulted from acidified seawater conditions of culture, were more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. We suggested that ocean acidification owing to atmospheric CO2 rising would be more effective on G. lemaneiformis growth and nutritional constituent accumulation during the middle and later periods of mariculture concurring with increased seasonal temperature." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification is one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time, and not surprisingly, we have seen a recent explosion of research into the physiological impacts and ecological consequences of changes in ocean chemistry. We are gaining considerable insights from this work, but further advances require greater integration across disciplines. Here we showed that projected near-future CO2 levels impaired the ability of damselfish to learn the identity of predators. These effects stem from impaired neurotransmitter function; impaired learning under elevated CO2 was reversed when fish were treated with gabazine, an antagonist of the GABA-A receptor – a major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain of vertebrates. The effects of CO2 on learning and the link to neurotransmitter interference were manifested as major differences in survival for fish released into the wild. Lower survival under elevated CO2, as a result of impaired learning, could have a major influence on population recruitment.  " ;

    :description "Theoretical models predict that ocean acidification, caused by increased dissolved CO2, will reduce the maximum thermal limits of fishes, thereby increasing their vulnerability to rising ocean temperatures and transient heatwaves. Here, we tested this prediction in three species of damselfishes on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Maximum thermal limits were quantified using critical thermal maxima (CTmax) tests following acclimation to either present-day or end-of-century levels of CO2 for coral reef environments (∼500 or ∼1000 µatm, respectively). While species differed significantly in their thermal limits, whereby Dischistodus perspicillatus exhibited greater CTmax (37.88±0.03°C; N=47) than Dascyllus aruanus (37.68±0.02°C; N=85) and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (36.58±0.02°C; N=63), end-of-century CO2 had no effect (D. aruanus) or a slightly positive effect (increase in CTmax of 0.16°C in D. perspicillatus and 0.21°C in A. polyacanthus) on CTmax Contrary to expectations, early-stage juveniles were equally as resilient to CO2 as larger conspecifics, and CTmax was higher at smaller body sizes in two species. These findings suggest that ocean acidification will not impair the maximum thermal limits of reef fishes, and they highlight the critical role of experimental biology in testing predictions of theoretical models forecasting the consequences of environmental change." ;

    :description "Changing climatic conditions are affecting the relationship between fishing communities and the marine resources they depend on. This shift will require an adaptive response on the part of policy makers and fishery managers. In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established, in its fisheries agency (NOAA Fisheries), a set of social indicators of fishing community vulnerability and resilience to evaluate the impacts of changes in fishery management regimes. These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being." ;

One of the least considered physical parameters is water flow, which is surprising considering its strong role in modulating the physiology of reef organisms and communities. In the present study, the effects of flow were tested on coral reef communities maintained in outdoor flumes under ambient pCO2 and high pCO2 (1300 $μ$atm). Net calcification of coral communities, including sediments, was affected by both flow and pCO2 with calcification correlated positively with flow under both pCO2 treatments. The effect of flow was less evident for sediments where dissolution exceeded precipitation of calcium carbonate under all flow speeds at high pCO2. For corals and calcifying algae there was a strong flow effect, particularly at high pCO2 where positive net calcification was maintained at night in the high flow treatment. Our results demonstrate the importance of water flow in modulating the coral reef community response to OA and highlight the need to consider this parameter when assessing the effects of OA on coral reefs." ;

    :description "While ocean acidification is likely to have major effects on many marine organisms, those species that regularly experience variable pCO2 environments may be more tolerant of future predicted changes in ocean chemistry. Euphausia pacifica is an abundant krill species along the Pacific coast of North America and one that regularly experiences varying pCO2 levels during seasonal upwelling, as well as during daily vertical migrations to depth where pCO2 is higher. Krill were collected from Monterey Bay, California (36.8°N, 121.9°W), and experiments were performed from June to August 2014 and maintained at two pCO2 levels (400 and 1200 µatm). Three metabolic responses (oxygen consumption, ingestion rate, and nutrient excretion rates) of E. pacifica were measured. Oxygen consumption declined by 31 % in the first 24 h following exposure to high pCO2 and remained low after 21 days. Oxygen consumption at low pCO2 was low for the first 12 h, increased by 34 % at 24 h, but returned to initial values by 21 days. After 3 weeks of continuous exposure, oxygen consumption rates were 32 % lower in the high pCO2 group. Ingestion and ammonium excretion rates were both significantly lower in the high pCO2 group after 24-h exposure, but not after 7 or 21 days. There was no effect of pCO2 on phosphate excretion. Taken together, these results indicate that E. pacifica has a lower metabolic rate during both short-term (24 h) and longer-term (21 days) exposure to high pCO2. Such metabolic depression may explain previously reported declines in growth of E. pacifica exposed to high pCO2." ;

Seasonal upwelling brings low pH water to the surface along the Pacific Coast of North America. In Monterey Bay, California Euphausia pacifica , a key species supporting a diverse multi-trophic-level ecosystem, currently experiences broad pCO 2 and pH ranges due to both diel vertical migrations and seasonal upwelling. We determined tolerances of E. pacifica to prolonged exposure to pH levels predicted for 2100 by maintaining adults at two pCO 2 levels (380 and 1200 µatm) for 2 months. Rates of survival and moulting were the same at both pCO 2 levels. High pCO 2 slowed growth in all size classes. In additional experiments to determine pCO 2 threshold levels above which E. pacifica is adversely affected, survival was not affected down to pH 6.96 (6050 µatm), but declined rapidly at pH 6.92 (7228 µatm) and lower, with 100% mortality within 10 d at pH 6.89." ;

    :description "Anthropogenically-modulated reductions in pH, termed ocean acidification, could pose a major threat to the physiological performance, stocks, and biodiversity of calcifiers and may devalue their ecosystem services. Recent debate has focussed on the need to develop approaches to arrest the potential negative impacts of ocean acidification on ecosystems dominated by calcareous organisms. In this study, we demonstrate the role of a discrete (i.e. diffusion) boundary layer (DBL), formed at the surface of some calcifying species under slow flows, in buffering them from the corrosive effects of low pH seawater. The coralline macroalga Arthrocardia corymbosa was grown in a multifactorial experiment with two mean pH levels (8.05 ‘ambient' and 7.65 a worst case ‘ocean acidification' scenario projected for 2100), each with two levels of seawater flow (fast and slow, i.e. DBL thin or thick). Coralline algae grown under slow flows with thick DBLs (i.e., unstirred with regular replenishment of seawater to their surface) maintained net growth and calcification at pH 7.65 whereas those in higher flows with thin DBLs had net dissolution. Growth under ambient seawater pH (8.05) was not significantly different in thin and thick DBL treatments. No other measured diagnostic (recruit sizes and numbers, photosynthetic metrics, %C, %N, %MgCO3) responded to the effects of reduced seawater pH. Thus, flow conditions that promote the formation of thick DBLs, may enhance the subsistence of calcifiers by creating localised hydrodynamic conditions where metabolic activity ameliorates the negative impacts of ocean acidification." ;

    :description "Increasing levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the world's oceans are resulting in a decrease in the availability of carbonate ions and a drop in seawater pH. This process, known as ocean acidification, is a potential threat to marine populations via alterations in survival and development. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of ocean acidification on rare or endangered species. To begin to assess the impacts of acidification on endangered northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) populations, we exposed H. kamtschatkana larvae to various levels of CO2 [400 ppm (ambient), 800 ppm, and 1800 ppm CO2] and measured survival, settlement, shell size, and shell development. Larval survival decreased by ca. 40% in elevated CO2 treatments relative to the 400 ppm control. However, CO2 had no effect on the proportion of surviving larvae that metamorphosed at the end of the experiment. Larval shell abnormalities became apparent in approximately 40% of larvae reared at 800 ppm CO2, and almost all larvae reared at 1800 ppm CO2 either developed an abnormal shell or lacked a shell completely. Of the larvae that did not show shell abnormalities, shell size was reduced by 5% at 800 ppm compared to the control. Overall, larval development of H. kamtschatkana was found to be sensitive to ocean acidification. Near future levels of CO2 will likely pose a significant additional threat to this species, which is already endangered with extinction due in part to limited reproductive output and larval recruitment.

    :description "Changes in olfactory-mediated behaviour caused by elevated CO2 levels in the ocean could affect recruitment to reef fish populations because larval fish become more vulnerable to predation. However, it is currently unclear how elevated CO2 will impact the other key part of the predator-prey interaction – the predators. We investigated the effects of elevated CO2 and reduced pH on olfactory preferences, activity levels and feeding behaviour of a common coral reef meso-predator, the brown dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). Predators were exposed to either current-day CO2 levels or one of two elevated CO2 levels (̃600 µatm or \\̃950 µatm) that may occur by 2100 according to climate change predictions. Exposure to elevated CO2 and reduced pH caused a shift from preference to avoidance of the smell of injured prey, with CO2 treated predators spending approximately 20% less time in a water stream containing prey odour compared with controls. Furthermore, activity levels of fish was higher in the high CO2 treatment and feeding activity was lower for fish in the mid CO2 treatment; indicating that future conditions may potentially reduce the ability of the fish to respond rapidly to fluctuations in food availability. Elevated activity levels of predators in the high CO2 treatment, however, may compensate for reduced olfactory ability, as greater movement facilitated visual detection of food. Our findings show that, at least for the species tested to date, both parties in the predator-prey relationship may be affected by ocean acidification. Although impairment of olfactory-mediated behaviour of predators might reduce the risk of predation for larval fishes, the magnitude of the observed effects of elevated CO2 acidification appear to be more dramatic for prey compared to predators. Thus, it is unlikely that the altered behaviour of predators is sufficient to fully compensate for the effects of ocean acidification on prey mortality.  " ;

    :description "Recent observations of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral undersaturations on the Bering Sea Shelf have prompted new interest in the physical and biological factors that control the inorganic carbon system in the region. Understanding of the dynamics that influence the spatio-temporal variability of total alkalinity (TA) – one major component of the seawater carbonate system – has been constrained by limited historical data collected across the shelf, and the consensus has been that TA is largely conservative. However, the recently documented undersaturated conditions have the potential to cause substantial non-conservative variability in TA in this region through the dissolution of carbonate minerals. In order to quantify the contribution of carbonate mineral precipitation and dissolution to variability in TA on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf, we examined seasonal observations of TA that were made between 2008 and 2010 as part of the BEST-BSIERP Bering Sea Project. Conservative influences accounted for most of the variability in TA concentrations, with well-constrained mixing dominating in spring and summer of 2008. Bering Shelf Water (BSW) contained a constant ratio of TA to salinity, while river discharge (RW) added TA relative to salinity at a predictable rate. Although substantial organic carbon production and denitrification can cause some non-conservative variation in TA concentrations (a maximum of ̃ 15 $μ$moles kg SW- 1 combined), carbonate mineral dissolution and precipitation were shown to be the most important processes responsible for non-conservative TA – salinity relationships. CaCO3 uptake by the dominant pelagic phytoplankton calcifier (i.e., coccolithophores) was shown to alter TA concentrations by as much as 59 $μ$moles kg SW- 1. Evidence for shallow-water CaCO3 mineral dissolution was also observed, which caused TA concentrations to increase by as much as 36 $μ$moles kg SW- 1. Therefore, contrary to our previous understanding, the non-conservative physico-biogeochemical factors observed in this study play an important role in controlling the ocean carbon cycle of the Bering Sea shelf.

Although permeable sediments represent the largest reservoir of CaCO3 in coral reefs, the dissolution of shallow CaCO3 sands under future pCO2 levels has not been measured under natural conditions. In situ, advective chamber incubations under elevated pCO2 (̃800 µatm) shifted the sediments from net precipitating to net dissolving. Pore water advection more than doubled dissolution rates (1.10 g CaCO3 m−2 d−1) when compared to diffusive conditions (0.42 g CaCO3 m−2 d−1). Sediment dissolution could reduce net ecosystem calcification rates of the Heron Island lagoon by 8% within the next century, which is equivalent to a 25% reduction in the global average calcification rate of coral lagoons. The dissolution of CaCO3 sediments needs to be taken into account in order to address how OA will impact the net accretion of coral reefs under future predicted increases in CO2." ;

    :description "Dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved oxygen, H+, and alkalinity fluxes from permeable carbonate sediments at Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef) were measured over one diel cycle using benthic chambers designed to induce advective pore-water exchange. A complex hysteretic pattern between carbonate precipitation and dissolution in sands and the aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$Ar) of the overlying chamber water was observed throughout the incubations. During the day, precipitation followed a hysteretic pattern based on the incidence of photosynthetically active radiation with lower precipitation rates in the morning than in the afternoon. The observed diel hysteresis seems to reflect a complex interaction between photosynthesis and respiration rather than $Ømega$Ar of the overlying water as the main driver of carbonate precipitation and dissolution within these permeable sediments. Changes in flux rates over a diel cycle demonstrate the importance of taking into account the short-term variability of benthic metabolism when calculating net daily flux rates. Based on one diel cycle, the sediments were a net daily source of alkalinity to the water column (5.13 to 8.84 mmol m−2 d−1, depending on advection rates), and advection had a net stimulatory effect on carbonate dissolution. The enhanced alkalinity release associated with benthic metabolism and pore-water advection may partially buffer shallow coral reef ecosystems against ocean acidification on a local scale.  " ;

    :description "Mg/Ca ratio paleothermometry in foraminifera is an important tool for the reconstruction and interpretation of past environments. However, existing Mg/Ca:temperature relationships for planktic species inhabiting mid- and high- latitude environments are limited by a lack of information about the development and impact of low-Mg/Ca ratio “crusts” and the influence of the carbonate system on Mg/Ca ratios in these groups. To address this, we cultured individual specimens of Neogloboquadrina incompta and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma in seawater across a range of temperature (6 °- 12 °C) and pH (7.4 – 8.2). We found by laser ablation inductively couple mass spectrometry analyses of shells that culture-grown crust calcite in N. incompta had a lower Mg/Ca ratio than ontogenetic calcite formed at the same temperature, suggesting that temperature is not responsible for the low Mg/Ca ratio of neogloboquadrinid crusts. The Mg/Ca:temperature relationship for ontogenetic calcite in N. incompta was consistent with the previously published culture-based relationship and no significant relationship was found between Mg/Ca ratios and pH in this species. However, the Mg/Ca ratio in laboratory cultured N. pachyderma was much higher than that reported in previous core-top and sediment trap samples, due to lack of crust formation in culture. Application of our ontogenetic calcite-specific Mg/Ca:temperature relationships to fossil N. pachyderma and N. incompta from five intervals in cores from the Santa Barbara Basin and the Bering Sea show that excluding crust calcite in fossil specimens may improve Mg/Ca-based temperature estimates." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification is a global phenomenon with highly regional spatial and temporal patterns. In order to address the challenges of future ocean acidification at a regional scale, it is necessary to increase the resolution of spatial and temporal monitoring of the inorganic carbon system beyond what is currently available. One approach is to develop empirical regional models that enable aragonite saturation state to be estimated from existing hydrographic measurements, for which greater spatial coverage and longer time series exist in addition to higher spatial and temporal resolution. We present such a relationship for aragonite saturation state for waters off Northern California based on in situ bottle sampling and instrumental measurements of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Application of this relationship to existing datasets (5 to 200 m depth) demonstrates both seasonal and interannual variability in aragonite saturation state. We document a deeper aragonite saturation horizon and higher near surface aragonite saturation state in the summers of 2014 and 2015 (compared with 2010–2013), associated with anomalous warm conditions and decadal scale oscillations. Application of this model to time series data reiterates the direct association between low aragonite saturation state and upwelled waters and highlights the extent to which benthic communities on the Northern California shelf are already exposed to aragonite undersaturated waters." ;

Recent studies show that exposure to elevated CO2 causes olfactory impairment in reef fishes; however, the ecological consequences of this impairment are largely unknown. This study examined the effects of short-term exposure to elevated CO2 on habitat preferences of coral-dwelling gobies. Adult gobies collected from the reef at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) were exposed for 4 days to ambient CO2 (440 $μ$atm) or elevated CO2 (880 $μ$atm). Habitat preferences were then tested in laboratory and field experiments at ambient conditions. In olfactory preference tests, Paragobiodon xanthosomus displayed a strong preference for odour cues of their sole host coral Seriatopora hystrix; however, this preference was absent in gobies exposed to elevated CO2. Habitat choice experiments conducted in the field showed that Gobiodon histrio placed on dead coral colonies located preferred live habitat within 24 h; however, gobies exposed to elevated CO2 associated with both preferred and non-preferred habitats in approximately equal frequency. Preferred habitats are known to confer fitness advantages to coral-dwelling gobies. Consequently, these results suggest that future elevated CO2 levels might affect the ability of habitat specialist fishes to select favourable habitats." ;

However, due to the presence of multiple carbonate minerals with different solubilities in seawater, the algal mineralogical responses to changes in carbonate chemistry are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a 200% increase in dolomite concentration in living CCA under greenhouse conditions of high pCO2 (1,225 muatm) and warming (30 degrees C). Aragonite, in contrast, increases with lower pCO2 (296 muatm) and low temperature (28 degrees C). Mineral changes in the surface pigmented skeleton are minor and dolomite and aragonite formation largely occurs in the white crust beneath. Dissolution of high-Mg-calcite and particularly the erosive activities of endolithic algae living inside skeletons play key roles in concentrating dolomite in greenhouse treatments. As oceans acidify and warm in the future, the relative abundance of dolomite in CCA will increase." ;

    :description "The boron isotopic ($δ$11Bcarb) compositions of long-lived Porites coral are used to reconstruct reef-water pH across the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and assess the impact of river runoff on inshore reefs. For the period from 1940 to 2009, corals from both inner- and mid-shelf sites exhibit the same overall decrease in $δ$11Bcarb of 0.086 ± 0.033‰ per decade, equivalent to a decline in seawater pH (pHsw) of ̃0.017 ± 0.007 pH units per decade. This decline is consistent with the long-term effects of ocean acidification based on estimates of CO2 uptake by surface waters due to rising atmospheric levels. We also find that, compared to the mid-shelf corals, the $δ$11Bcarb compositions of inner-shelf corals subject to river discharge events have higher and more variable values, and hence higher inferred pHsw values. These higher $δ$11Bcarb values of inner-shelf corals are particularly evident during wet years, despite river waters having lower pH. The main effect of river discharge on reef-water carbonate chemistry thus appears to be from reduced aragonite saturation state and higher nutrients driving increased phytoplankton productivity, resulting in the drawdown of pCO2 and increase in pHsw. Increased primary production therefore has the potential to counter the more transient effects of low-pH river water (pHrw) discharged into near-shore environments. Importantly, however, inshore reefs also show a consistent pattern of sharply declining coral growth that coincides with periods of high river discharge. This occurs despite these reefs having higher pHsw, demonstrating the overriding importance of local reef-water quality and reduced aragonite saturation state on coral reef health. " ;

    :description "The average pH of ocean surface waters has dropped by about 30%, due to absorption of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In the past decade, much research has been conducted examining the effect of this “ocean acidification” on marine organisms. Larvae seem especially sensitive. Acidification has been shown to affect chemosensory mechanisms and behavior of clownfish larvae, but little is known about how acidification may affect the sensory biology of marine invertebrate larvae. Like many marine invertebrates, the gastropod Crepidula fornicata settles and metamorphoses in response to chemical cues associated with favorable habitat for juveniles. Other studies on marine invertebrates have found decreased settlement and metamorphosis at lower pH, but none have measured how pH affects settlement and metamorphosis in response to cues from adult conspecifics. We tested the effect of pH on settlement and metamorphosis of four broods of larvae of C. fornicata that were derived from different parents. pH had a significant overall effect on both settlement and metamorphosis in the presence of adults, but not in the direction expected. Larvae settled and metamorphosed at higher frequency at pH 7.5 and 7.7 than at pH 8.0. While this pattern was seen in three of the four broods tested, response to pH treatment varied between broods. Further research is needed to determine if differences between broods remain consistent throughout the larval period, and might therefore reflect adaptations to variable pH regimes in estuarine environments." ;

    :description "Concern about the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on ecosystem function has prompted many studies to focus on larval recruitment, demonstrating declines in settlement and early growth at elevated CO2 concentrations. Since larval settlement is often driven by particular cues governed by crustose coralline algae (CCA), it is important to determine whether OA reduces larval recruitment with specific CCA and the generality of any effects. We tested the effect of elevated CO2 on the survival and settlement of larvae from the common spawning coral Acropora selago with 3 ecologically important species of CCA, Porolithon onkodes, Sporolithon sp., and Titanoderma sp. After 3 d in no-choice laboratory assays at 447, 705, and 1214 µatm pCO2, the rates of coral settlement declined as pCO2 increased with all CCA taxa. The magnitude of the effect was highest with Titanoderma sp., decreasing by 87% from the ambient to highest CO2 treatment. In general, there were high rates of larval mortality, which were greater with the P. onkodes and Sporolithon sp. treatments (̃80%) compared to the Titanoderma sp. treatment (65%). There was an increase in larval mortality as pCO2 increased, but this was variable among the CCA species. It appears that OA reduces coral settlement by rapidly altering the chemical cues associated with the CCA thalli and microbial community, and potentially by directly affecting larval viability.  " ;

    :description """The resilient development and diversification of Fiji’s energy sector is a long-term priority for the Fijian\r
Government due in part to rising national energy demand, volatile oil prices, ageing energy\r

infrastructure, environment, people, and economy. Beyond these factors and trends there is an array\r
of current and projected socio-economic and cultural changes that are reconfiguring the way Fijians\r
utilise different forms of energy and depend on energy services. The introduction of new energy\r
technologies, increased digitization, and shifting national preferences will continue to further change\r
the way energy services must be designed, scaled, and delivered. These factors mean that specific\r
actions and policy measures will be required to adapt to an array of changing demand parameters\r
that must be met to maintain and improve energy security.\r
National energy production and consumption in Fiji remains highly dependent on imported fossil fuels\r
in part due to the current demands of the transport sector and the ongoing reliance on thermal power\r
plants to supplement renewable energy sources within Fiji’s electricity sector. In light of Fiji’s\r
commitments to address both the causes and impacts of climate change and transition rapidly to a\r
sustainable economy producing net-zero emissions annually by 2050, this National Energy Policy\r
provides the intent, direction, and priority objectives to support national energy security, achieve\r

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA) has been shown to affect significantly the net calcification process and growth rate of many marine calcifying organisms. Recent studies have shown that the responses of these organisms to OA can vary significantly among species. However, much less is known concerning the intraspecific variability in response to OA. In this study, we compared simultaneously the responses of two populations of the edible mussel Mytilus chilensis (Hupe) exposed to OA. Three nominal CO2 concentrations (380, 700, and 1,000 $μ$atm of CO2) were used. Negative effects of CO2 increase on net calcification rate were only found in individuals from Huelmo Bay. However, no effects were found in individuals from Yaldad Bay. Moreover, OA had not significant effects on the shell dissolution rate in individuals from both localities. This suggests that the negative effect of the OA on the net calcification rate of this species is explained by shell deposition, but not by the shell dissolution processes. We do not know the specific underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences, but some possibilities are discussed. These results highlight that the responses of marine organism to OA can be highly variable even within the same species. Therefore, more studies across the distribution range of the species, considering environmental variability, are needed for a better understanding of the consequences of OA on marine organisms. Finally, because mussels exert influence on their physical and biological surroundings, the negative effects of a CO2 increase could have significant ecological consequences." ;

The behaviour of the stock and the resulting fishery were analysed in a bioeconomic model structured by age, taking into account different market prices and fishing efforts. The results were compared in decision matrices that used the MiniMax and MaxMin criteria to determine the management strategy that best reduced the impact of  acidification. The largest stock reduction occurred during the first years of exploitation (B10\\textgreaterB15/BO) and all the variables that were considered did stabilize with time, reaching bioeconomic equilibrium. The worst scenario for not considering acidification occurred with low market prices, while the increase in price decreased the exploitation rate. The recruitment reduction determined the maximum effort that should have been applied; under such conditions it is recommended to operate an effort of 137 boats, considering the best market price." ;

    :description "Body size has large effects on organism physiology, but these effects remain poorly understood in modular animals with complex morphologies. Using two trials of a ∼24 day experiment conducted in 2014 and 2015, we tested the hypothesis that colony size of the coral Pocillopora verrucosa affects the response of calcification, aerobic respiration and gross photosynthesis to temperature (∼26.5 and ∼29.7°C) and PCO2  (∼40 and ∼1000 µatm). Large corals calcified more than small corals, but at a slower size-specific rate; area-normalized calcification declined with size. Whole-colony and area-normalized calcification were unaffected by temperature, PCO2 , or the interaction between the two. Whole-colony respiration increased with colony size, but the slopes of these relationships differed between treatments. Area-normalized gross photosynthesis declined with colony size, but whole-colony photosynthesis was unaffected by PCO2 , and showed a weak response to temperature. When scaled up to predict the response of large corals, area-normalized metrics of physiological performance measured using small corals provide inaccurate estimates of the physiological performance of large colonies. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of colony size in modulating the response of branching corals to elevated temperature and high PCO2." ;

    :description "Rising anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere is accompanied by an increase in oceanic CO2 and a concomitant decline in seawater pH (ref. 1). This phenomenon, known as ocean acidification (OA), has been experimentally shown to impact the biology and ecology of numerous animals and plants, most notably those that precipitate calcium carbonate skeletons, such as reef-building corals. Volcanically acidified water at Maug, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is equivalent to near-future predictions for what coral reef ecosystems will experience worldwide due to OA. We provide the first chemical and ecological assessment of this unique site and show that acidification-related stress significantly influences the abundance and diversity of coral reef taxa, leading to the often-predicted shift from a coral to an algae-dominated state4, 5. This study provides field evidence that acidification can lead to macroalgae dominance on reefs." ;

    :description "We tested the hypothesis that ocean acidification (OA) affects spatial competition among scleractinian corals. Competitive ability was evaluated indirectly by linear extension of Porites lutea and Montipora aequituberculata placed in intraspecific, interspecific, and control pairings (paired with dead coral skeleton) and exposed to ambient (̃400 µatm) and elevated (\\̃1000 µatm) pCO2 in experiments conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia, and Okinawa, Japan. High pCO2 had no effect on linear extension of M. aequituberculata in Moorea, but in Okinawa, it reduced linear extension 37%; high pCO2 had no significant effect on linear extension of P. lutea in Okinawa. Much of the negative effect of high pCO2 on linear extension for M. aequituberculata in Okinawa was due to reduced extension in control pairings, with corals engaged in intra- and interspecific competition unaffected by OA. Linear extension of M. aequituberculata and P. lutea in interspecific pairings decreased relative to control pairings at ambient pCO2 by 39 and 71%, respectively, indicating a strong effect of competition on extension rates. These differences however disappeared at elevated pCO2 when the linear extension of controls was depressed. Together, our results show that OA can negatively affect the linear extension of corals not engaged in competition, as shown in the control pairings, and suggest that OA does not directly affect the ability of corals to compete with one another for space.

    :description "The ecological effects of ocean acidification (OA) from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on benthic marine communities are largely unknown. We investigated in situ the consequences of long-term exposure to high CO2 on coral-reef-associated macroinvertebrate communities around three shallow volcanic CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea. The densities of many groups and the number of taxa (classes and phyla) of macroinvertebrates were significantly reduced at elevated CO2 (425–1100 µatm) compared with control sites. However, sensitivities of some groups, including decapod crustaceans, ascidians and several echinoderms, contrasted with predictions of their physiological CO2 tolerances derived from laboratory experiments. High CO2 reduced the availability of structurally complex corals that are essential refugia for many reef-associated macroinvertebrates. This loss of habitat complexity was also associated with losses in many macroinvertebrate groups, especially predation-prone mobile taxa, including crustaceans and crinoids. The transition from living to dead coral as substratum and habitat further altered macroinvertebrate communities, with far more taxa losing than gaining in numbers. Our study shows that indirect ecological effects of OA (reduced habitat complexity) will complement its direct physiological effects and together with the loss of coral cover through climate change will severely affect macroinvertebrate communities in coral reefs.

    :description "Summary      Synergies among stressors drive unanticipated changes to alternative states, yet little has been done to assess whether alleviating one or more contributing stressors may disrupt these interactions. It would be particularly useful to understand whether the synergistic effects of global and local stressors could be alleviated, leading to slower change or faster recovery, if conditions under the control of local management alone were managed (i.e. nutrient pollution).     We utilized field-based mesocosms to manipulate CO2 (i.e. forecasted global concentrations) and nutrients (i.e. local pollution) to test the hypothesis that, where synergies exist, reducing one contributing stressor would limit the effect of the other. In testing this hypothesis, we considered the response of turfing algae, which can displace kelp forests on urbanized coastlines.     Initial manipulations of CO2 and nutrient enrichment produced an anticipated synergistic effect on the biomass of turfing algae.     Following exposure of algal turfs to a combination of enriched nutrients and CO2, a subsequent reduction in nutrients was able to substantially slow further increases in turf growth. Despite this substantial effect, the historical legacy of previous nutrient enrichment was evident as greater turf was maintained relative to ambient conditions (i.e. ambient CO2 and nutrients). Such legacies of past stressors may be stubborn (e.g. persist as intergenerational change) where the alternative state (i.e. turf algae) has substantial resilience to restorative actions.     Synthesis and applications. As stressors accumulate across global to local scales, some combine to produce synergistic effects which cause changes of disproportionate ecological magnitude. While strong synergies attract heavy scrutiny, there remains substantial merit in assessing whether their influence can be ameliorated by managing a contributing stressor. Of note, we show that by reducing a locally determined stressor (nutrients), its synergistic effects with a globally determined stressor (CO2 enrichment) on a key taxon (turf algae) may be substantially reduced. These results suggest that in the face of changing climate (e.g. ocean acidification), the management of local stressors (e.g. water pollution) may have a greater contribution in determining the dominant state than current thinking allows.

    :description "Variation in rates of herbivory may be driven by direct effects of the abiotic environment on grazers, as well as indirect effects mediated by their food. Disentangling these direct and indirect effects is of fundamental importance for ecological forecasts of changing climate on species interactions and their influence on biogenic habitat. Whilst elevated atmospheric CO2 may have direct effects on grazers with calcareous structures via ‘ocean acidification', it may also have indirect effects via changes caused to their food. In our study we initially tested, and confirmed, that enriched CO2 altered per capita rates of grazing before assessing the relative importance of indirect and direct effects in driving this response. Our results eliminated the model of a direct effect of CO2 enrichment on the grazers themselves and supported the model of an indirect effect driven by a change in the food (i.e. turf algae). We suggest that this indirect effect manifested as grazers responded to the increased nitrogen content (i.e. %N) of algal tissue that resulted under CO2 enrichment. Understanding such indirect effects of modified environmental conditions provide important mechanistic links between climate conditions and the ecological processes they influence. " ;

    :description "In an ocean with rapidly changing chemistry, studies have assessed coral skeletal health under projected ocean acidification (OA) scenarios by characterizing morphological distortions in skeletal architecture and measuring bulk properties, such as net calcification and dissolution. Few studies offer more detailed information on skeletal mineralogy. Since aragonite crystallography will at least partially govern the material properties of coral skeletons, such as solubility and strength, it is important to understand how it is influenced by environmental stressors. Here, we take a mineralogical approach using micro X-ray diffraction (XRD) and whole pattern Rietveld refinement analysis to track crystallographic shifts in deep-sea coral Lophelia pertusa samples collected along a natural seawater aragonite saturation state gradient ($Ømega$sw = 1.15–1.44) in the Gulf of Mexico. Our results reveal statistically significant linear relationships between rising $Ømega$sw and increasing unit cell volume driven by an anisotropic lengthening along the b-axis. These structural changes are similarly observed in synthetic aragonites precipitated under various saturation states, indicating that these changes are inherent to the crystallography of aragonite. Increased crystallographic disorder via widening of the full width at half maximum of the main (111) XRD peaks trend with increased Ba substitutions for Ca, however, trace substitutions by Ba, Sr, and Mg do not trend with crystal lattice parameters in our samples. Instead, we observe a significant trend of increasing calcite content as a function of both decreasing unit cell parameters as well as decreasing $Ømega$sw. This may make calcite incorporation an important factor to consider in coral crystallography, especially under varying aragonite saturation states ($Ømega$Ar). Finally, by defining crystallography-based linear relationships between $Ømega$Ar of synthetic aragonite analogs and lattice parameters, we predict internal calcifying fluid saturation state ($Ømega$cf = 11.1–17.3 calculated from b-axis lengths; 15.2–25.2 calculated from unit cell volumes) for L. pertusa, which may allow this species to calcify despite the local seawater conditions. This study will ideally pave the way for future studies to utilize quantitative XRD in exploring the impact of physical and chemical stressors on biominerals." ;

    :description """The Cooperative Study on the Deepsea Mineral Resources in Selected Offshore Areas of the SOPAC Region, 1998, Federated States of Micronesia. Survey was conducted in an area of 1,265,000km2 within the exclusive economic zones of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.The survey areas for this study are the areas approximately 551,793km2 in the eastern sea area, and 712,683km2 in the western sea area.These areas were selected in accordance with the joint study program for marine mineral 
resources in the exclusive economic waters of the SOPAC member countries agreed upon by Japanese 
executing agency and South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) on 13 March 1995. Two marine areas, namely the eastern sea area centered around the oceanic plateau with Anewetak Atoll and Ujelang Atoll of the Republic of Marshall Islands, and the western sea area in the vicinity of the Caroline Islands of Yap Province of the Federated States of Micronesia were selected as the surveyed areas with reference to previous survey. A total of seven sea mounts were selected.Topographic, acoustic, seafloor observation, sampling and other surveys were carried out. On land; samples were identified and analyzed, data were analyzed and interpreted.The purpose of the survey is to assess the potential of submarine mineral resources within the 
Exclusive Economic Zones of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of 
Micronesia, members of SOPAC, through submarine topographical survey, sampling and other surveys.EASTERN AREA: Latitude,Longitude      Eastern Area                .

    :description "Puget Sound is a large estuary complex in the U.S. Pacific Northwest that is home to a diverse and economically important ecosystem threatened by anthropogenic impacts associated with climate change, urbanization, and ocean acidification. While ocean acidification has been studied in oceanic waters, little is known regarding its status in estuaries. Anthropogenically acidified coastal waters upwelling along the western North American continental margin can enter Puget Sound through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. In order to study the combined effects of ocean acidification and other natural and anthropogenic processes on Puget Sound waters, we made the first inorganic carbon measurements in this estuary on two survey cruises in February and August of 2008. Observed pH and aragonite saturation state values in surface and subsurface waters were substantially lower in parts of Puget Sound than would be expected from anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake alone. We estimate that ocean acidification can account for 24–49% of the pH decrease in the deep waters of the Hood Canal sub-basin of Puget Sound relative to estimated pre-industrial values. The remaining change in pH between when seawater enters the sound and when it reaches this deep basin results from remineralization of organic matter due to natural or anthropogenically stimulated respiration processes within Puget Sound. Over time, however, the relative impact of ocean acidification could increase significantly, accounting for 49–82% of the pH decrease in subsurface waters for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. These changes may have profound impacts on the Puget Sound ecosystem over the next several decades. These estimates suggest that the role ocean acidification will play in estuaries may be different from the open ocean.   " ;

    :description "Little is known about the impact of ocean acidification on predator–prey dynamics. Herein, we examined the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on both prey and predator by letting one predatory reef fish interact for 24 h with eight small or large juvenile damselfishes from four congeneric species. Both prey and predator were exposed to control or elevated levels of CO2. Mortality rate and predator selectivity were compared across CO2 treatments, prey size and species. Small juveniles of all species sustained greater mortality at high CO2 levels, while large recruits were not affected. For large prey, the pattern of prey selectivity by predators was reversed under elevated CO2. Our results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative consumptive effects of CO2 on small and larger damselfish recruits respectively, resulting from CO2-induced behavioural changes likely mediated by impaired neurological function. This study highlights the complexity of predicting the effects of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.  " ;

Readings(height observations) recorded from the gauge, is held in this record and provided in the form of Yearly Reports, Tide Prediction Calendars and Hourly Sea Level and meteorological data (update frequency- real time) from the Lautoka station and also readings from a Non-SPSLCMP Station in Suva, Viti Levu . This is downloadable from the Distribution Info Section of this metadata record and dataset available in digital text format. The gauge has been returning high resolution, good scientific quality data since installation.SEAFRAME gauges not only measure sea level by two independent means, but also a number of \"ancillary\" variables - air and water temperatures, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure. This is part of the AusAID-sponsored South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project (\"Pacific Project\") for the FORUM region, in response to concerns raised by its member countries over the potential impacts of an enhanced Greenhouse Effect on climate and sea levels in the South Pacific region.

    :description "The eastern boundary upwelling systems are among those regions that are most vulnerable to an ocean acidification‐induced transition toward undersaturated conditions with respect to mineral CaCO3, but no assessment exists yet for the Humboldt Current System. Here we use a high‐resolution (∼7.5 km) regional ocean model to investigate past and future changes in ocean pH and CaCO3 saturation state in this system. We find that within the next few decades, the nearshore waters off Peru are projected to become corrosive year round with regard to aragonite, the more soluble form of CaCO3. The volume of aragonite undersaturated water off Peru will continue to increase in the future irrespective of the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In contrast, the development of the saturation state with regard to calcite, a less soluble form of carbonate, depends strongly on the scenario followed. By 2050, calcite undersaturation appears in the nearshore waters off Peru occasionally, but by 2090 in a high‐emission scenario (RCP8.5), ∼60% of the water in the euphotic zone will become permanently calcite undersaturated. Most of this calcite undersaturation off Peru can likely be avoided if a low emission scenario (RCP2.6) consistent with the Paris Agreement is followed. The progression of ocean acidification off Chile follows a similar pattern, except that the saturation states are overall higher. But also here, calcite undersaturated waters will become common in the subsurface waters under the RCP8.5 scenario by the end of this century, while this can be avoided under the RCP2.6 scenario. " ;

    :description "As the ocean undergoes acidification, marine organisms will become increasingly exposed to reduced pH, yet variability in many coastal settings complicates our ability to accurately estimate pH exposure for those organisms that are difficult to track. Here we present larval shell-based geochemical proxies that reflect pH exposure from laboratory and field settings in larvae of the mussels Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis. Laboratory-based proxies were generated from shells precipitated at pH 7.51 to 8.04. U/Ca, Sr/Ca, and multi-elemental signatures represented as principal components varied with pH for both species. Of these, U/Ca was the best predictor of pH and did not vary with larval size, with semidiurnal pH fluctuations, or with oxygen concentration. Field applications of U/Ca were tested with mussel larvae reared in situ at both known and unknown pH conditions. Larval shells precipitated in a region of greater upwelling had higher U/Ca, and these U/Ca values corresponded well with the laboratory-derived U/Ca-pH proxy. Retention of the larval shell after settlement in molluscs allows use of this geochemical proxy to assess ocean acidification effects on marine populations." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA), the process by which increasing atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by the ocean, lowering the pH of surface waters, has been shown to affect many marine organisms negatively. It has been suggested that organisms from regions with naturally low pH waters, such as upwelling areas, could serve as models for future effects of OA and may be adapted to increased pCO2 levels. In this study, we examined the effects of OA on yellowfin tuna, a highly pelagic species that spawns in the eastern tropical Pacific, an area that includes regions of strong upwelling events. Larvae reared at decreasing pH levels (pH 8.1, 7.6, 7.3 and 6.9) showed increasing organ damage in the kidney, liver, pancreas, eye and muscle, which correlated with decreased growth and survival. These findings complement earlier studies on organ damage in Atlantic cod and herring larvae and demonstrate that OA may have detrimental effects on fish larvae, regardless of their pre-exposure to low pH waters." ;

However, little is understood regarding the impacts of ocean acidification on the CCMs of Ulva and the consequences of thalli's acclimation to ocean acidification in terms of responding to environmental factors. Here, we grew a cosmopolitan green alga, Ulva linza at ambient (LC) and elevated (HC) CO2 levels and investigated the alteration of CCMs in U. linza grown at HC and its responses to the changed seawater carbon chemistry and light intensity. The inhibitors experiment for photosynthetic inorganic carbon utilization demonstrated that acidic compartments, extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) and intracellular CA worked together in the thalli grown at LC and the acquisition of exogenous carbon source in the thalli could be attributed to the collaboration of acidic compartments and extracellular CA. Contrastingly, when U. linza was grown at HC, extracellular CA was completely inhibited, acidic compartments and intracellular CA were also down-regulated to different extents and thus the acquisition of exogenous carbon source solely relied on acidic compartments. The down-regulated CCMs in U. linza did not affect its responses to changes of seawater carbon chemistry but led to a decrease of net photosynthetic rate when thalli were exposed to increased light intensity. This decrease could be attributed to photodamage caused by the combination of the saved energy due to the down-regulated CCMs and high light intensity. Our findings suggest future ocean acidification might impose depressing effects on green tide events when combined with increased light exposure." ;

    :description "Understanding larval bivalve responses to variable regimes of seawater carbonate chemistry requires realistic quantification of physiological stress. Based on a degree-day modeling approach, we developed a new metric, the ocean acidification stress index for shellfish (OASIS), for this purpose. OASIS integrates over the entire larval period the instantaneous stress associated with deviations from published sensitivity thresholds to aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$Ar) while experiencing variable carbonate chemistry. We measured survival to D-hinge and pre-settlement stage of four Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) cohorts with different histories of carbonate chemistry exposure at the Whiskey Creek Hatchery, Netarts Bay, OR, to test the utility of OASIS as a stress metric and document the effects of buffering seawater in mitigating acute and chronic exposure to ocean acidification. Each cohort was divided into four groups and reared under the following conditions: 1) stable, buffered seawater for the entire larval period; 2) stable, buffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then naturally variable, unbuffered seawater; 3) stable, unbuffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then buffered seawater; and 4) stable, unbuffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then naturally variable, unbuffered seawater. Patterns in Netarts Bay carbonate chemistry were dominated by seasonal upwelling at the time of the experimental work, resulting in naturally highly variable $Ømega$Ar for the larvae raised in the unbuffered treatments. Two of the four cohorts showed strongly positive responses to buffering in survival to 48 hours; three of the four, in survival to pre-settlement. OASIS accurately predicted survival for two of the three cohorts tested (the fourth excluded due to other environmental factors), suggesting that this new metric could be used to better understand larval bivalve survival in naturally variable environments. OASIS may also be useful to an array of diverse stakeholders with increasing access to highly resolved temporal measurements of carbonate chemistry." ;

    :description "Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with potentially negative consequences for many calcifying marine organisms. At the same time, increasing fisheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic-invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidification, the potential impact of the two stressors of fishing and acidification on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidification and fishing were additive (30%), synergistic (33%), and antagonistic (37%). Strong ocean acidification resulted in additive (22%), synergistic (40%), and antagonistic (38%) effects. The greatest impact was on the demersal food web, with fishing impacting predation and acidification affecting benthic production. Areas that have been subject to intensive fishing were the most susceptible to acidification effect, although fishing also mitigated some of the decline in biodiversity observed with moderate acidification. The model suggested that ocean acidification and long-term fisheries exploitation could act synergistically with the increasing sensitivity to change from long-term (decades) fisheries exploitation potentially causing unexpected restructuring of the pelagic and demersal food webs. Major regime shifts occur around year 2040. Greater focus is needed on how differential fisheries exploitation of marine resources may exacerbate or accelerate effects of environmental changes such as ocean acidification. " ;

    :description "Ocean acidification is predicted to impact the structure and function of all marine ecosystems in this century. As focus turns towards possible impacts on interactions among marine organisms, its effects on the biology and transmission potential of marine parasites must be evaluated. In the present study, we investigate two marine trematode species (Philophthalmus sp. and Parorchis sp., both in the family Philophthalmidae) infecting two marine gastropods. These trematodes are unusual in that their asexually multiplying stages within snails display a division of labour, with two distinct castes, a large-bodied morph producing infective stages and a smaller morph playing a defensive role against other competing parasites. Using a potentiometric ocean acidification simulation system, we test the impacts of acidified seawater (7.8 and 7.6 pH) on the production of free-living infective stages (cercariae), the size and survival of encysted resting stages (metacercariae), and the within-host division of labour measured as the ratio between numbers of the two morphs. In general, low pH conditions caused an increase in cercarial production and a reduction in metacercarial survival. The ratio of the two castes within snail hosts tended to shift towards more of the smaller defensive morphs under low pH. However, the observed effects of reduced pH were species specific and not always unimodal. These results suggest that ocean acidification can affect the biology of marine parasites and may also impact transmission success and parasite abundance of some trematodes, with possible consequences for marine communities and ecosystems.

In this study, we simulated future atmospheric CO2 concentrations (800, 1500, 2000 and 3000 ppm) and examined the effects of ocean acidification on the early development of 3 mollusks (the abalones Haliotis diversicolor and H. discus hannai and the oyster Crassostrea angulata). We showed that fertilization rate, hatching rate, larval shell length, trochophore development, veliger survival and metamorphosis all decreased significantly at different pCO2 levels (except oyster hatching). H. discus hannai were more tolerant of high CO2 compared to H. diversicolor. At 2000 ppm CO2, 79.2% of H. discus hannai veliger larvae developed normally, but only 13.3% of H. diversicolor veliger larvae. Tolerance of C. angulata to ocean acidification was greater than the 2 abalone species; 50.5% of its D‑larvae developed normally at 3000 ppm CO2. This apparent resistance of C. angulata to ocean acidification may be attributed to their adaptability to estuarine environments. Mechanisms underlying the resistance to ocean acidification of both abalones requires further investigation. Our results suggest that ocean acidification may decrease the yield of these 3 economically important shellfish if increasing CO2 is a future trend. " ;

    :description "In the California Current ecosystem, global climate change is predicted to trigger large-scale changes in ocean chemistry within this century. Ocean acidification-which occurs when increased levels of atmospheric CO2 dissolve into the ocean-is one of the biggest potential threats to marine life. In a coastal upwelling system, we compared the effects of chronic exposure to low pH (elevated pCO2) at four treatment levels (i.e., pCO2 = ambient [500], moderate [750], high [1900], and extreme [2800 $μ$atm]) on behavior, physiology, and patterns of gene expression in white muscle tissue of juvenile rockfish (genus Sebastes), integrating responses from the transcriptome to the whole organism level. Experiments were conducted simultaneously on two closely related species that both inhabit kelp forests, yet differ in early life history traits, to compare high-CO2 tolerance among species. Our findings indicate that these congeners express different sensitivities to elevated CO2 levels. Copper rockfish (S. caurinus) exhibited changes in behavioral lateralization, reduced critical swimming speed, depressed aerobic scope, changes in metabolic enzyme activity, and increases in the expression of transcription factors and regulatory genes at high pCO2 exposure. Blue rockfish (S. mystinus), in contrast, showed no significant changes in behavior, swimming physiology, or aerobic capacity, but did exhibit significant changes in the expression of muscle structural genes as a function of pCO2, indicating acclimatization potential. The capacity of long-lived, late to mature, commercially important fish to acclimatize and adapt to changing ocean chemistry over the next 50-100 years is likely dependent on species-specific physiological tolerances." ;

    :description "A geomorphic assessment of reef system calcification is conducted for past (3200 Ka to present), present and future (2010-2100) time periods. Reef platform sediment production is estimated at 569 m3 yr-1 using rate laws that express gross community carbonate production as a function of seawater aragonite saturation, community composition and rugosity and incorporating estimates of carbonate removal from the reef system. Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae and Halimeda are mapped accurately (mean R2 = 0.81). Community net production estimates correspond closely to independent census-based estimates made in-situ (R2 = 0.86). Reef-scale outputs are compared with historic rates of production generated from (i) radiocarbon evidence of island deposition initiation around 3200 years ago, and (ii) island volume calculated from a high resolution island digital elevation model. Contemporary carbonate production rates appear to be remarkably similar to historical values of 573 m3 yr-1. Anticipated future seawater chemistry parameters associated with an RCP8.5 emissions scenario are employed to model rates of net community calcification for the period 2000-2100 on the basis of an inorganic aragonite precipitation law, under the assumption of constant benthic community character. Simulations indicate that carbonate production will decrease linearly to a level of 118 m3 yr-1 by 2100 and that by 2150 aragonite saturation levels may no longer support the positive budgetary status necessary to sustain island accretion. Novel aspects of this assessment include the development of rate law parameters to realistically represent the variable composition of coral reef benthic carbonate producers, incorporation of three dimensional rugosity of the entire reef platform and the coupling of model outputs with both historical radiocarbon dating evidence and forward hydrochemical projections to conduct an assessment of island evolution through time. By combining several lines of evidence in a deterministic manner, an assessment of changes in carbonate production is carried out that has tangible geomorphic implications for sediment availability and associated island evolution." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification is expected to negatively impact many calcifying marine organisms by impairing their ability to build their protective shells and skeletons, and by causing dissolution and erosion. Here we investigated the large predatory “triton shell” gastropod Charonia lampas in acidified conditions near CO2 seeps off Shikine-jima (Japan) and compared them with individuals from an adjacent bay with seawater pH at present-day levels (outside the influence of the CO2 seep). By using computed tomography we show that acidification negatively impacts their thickness, density, and shell structure, causing visible deterioration to the shell surface. Periods of aragonite undersaturation caused the loss of the apex region and exposing body tissues. While gross calcification rates were likely reduced near CO2 seeps, the corrosive effects of acidification were far more pronounced around the oldest parts of the shell. As a result, the capacity of C. lampas to maintain their shells under ocean acidification may be strongly driven by abiotic dissolution and erosion, and not under biological control of the calcification process. Understanding the response of marine calcifying organisms and their ability to build and maintain their protective shells and skeletons will be important for our understanding of future marine ecosystems." ;

    :description "Eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS) are naturally more acidic than most of the rest of the surface ocean. Observations of EBUS already show pH values and saturation states with regard to the carbonate mineral aragonite that are as low as those expected for most open ocean waters several decades from now. Thus, as atmospheric CO2 increases further, EBUS are prone to widespread and persistent undersaturation with regard to aragonite, making them especially sensitive to ocean acidification. Here, we describe ocean carbonate chemistry and its short-term-to-seasonal variability in one major EBUS, the California Current System (CCS), based on observations and results from an eddy-resolving regional model. Results reveal high variability in ocean carbonate chemistry, largely driven by seasonal upwelling of waters with low pH and saturation states, and subsequent interactions of transport and biological production. Model simulations confirm that the pH of CCS waters has decreased by about 0.1 pH unit and by 0.5 in saturation state since pre-industrial times. A first assessment of the vulnerability of CCS marine organisms and ecosystems to ocean acidification suggests that there will be winners and losers, likely provoking changes in species composition. Benthic organisms appear to be among those that will be most affected by the continuing acidification of the CCS. More accurate projections require special consideration of the integrated effects of ocean acidification, ocean warming, decreasing oxygen levels, and other processes that are expected with global change.

Multivariate analyses indicated that elevated temperature played a greater role in altering physiological response, with the greatest degree of change occurring within M. monasteriata and T. reniformis. Algal cellular volume, protein, and lipid content all increased for M. monasteriata. Likewise, S. trenchii volume and protein content in T. reniformis also increased with temperature. Despite decreases in maximal photochemical efficiency, few changes in biochemical composition (i.e. lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) or cellular volume occurred at high temperature in the two thermally sensitive symbionts C21a and C1c-d-t. Intracellular carbonic anhydrase transcript abundance increased with temperature in A. millepora but not in P. damicornis, possibly reflecting differences in host mitigated carbon supply during thermal stress. Importantly, our results show that the host and symbiont response to climate change differs considerably across species and that greater physiological plasticity in response to elevated temperature may be an important strategy distinguishing thermally tolerant vs. thermally sensitive species." ;

    :description "Background  Recent reviews suggest that the warming and acidification of ocean surface waters predicated by most accepted climate projections will lead to mass mortality and declining calcification rates of reef-building corals. This study investigates the use of modeling techniques to quantitatively examine rates of coral cover change due to these effects.  Methodology/Principal Findings  Broad-scale probabilities of change in shallow-water scleractinian coral cover in the Hawaiian Archipelago for years 2000–2099 A.D. were calculated assuming a single middle-of-the-road greenhouse gas emissions scenario. These projections were based on ensemble calculations of a growth and mortality model that used sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), observed coral growth (calcification) rates, and observed mortality linked to mass coral bleaching episodes as inputs. SST and CO2 predictions were derived from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) multi-model dataset, statistically downscaled with historical data.  Conclusions/Significance  The model calculations illustrate a practical approach to systematic evaluation of climate change effects on corals, and also show the effect of uncertainties in current climate predictions and in coral adaptation capabilities on estimated changes in coral cover. Despite these large uncertainties, this analysis quantitatively illustrates that a large decline in coral cover is highly likely in the 21st Century, but that there are significant spatial and temporal variances in outcomes, even under a single climate change scenario." ;

Predicting how corals respond to CO2 requires a better understanding of how calcification is controlled. Here we show how spatial variations in the pH of the internal calcifying fluid (pHcf) in coral (Stylophora pistillata) colonies correlates with differential sensitivity of calcification to acidification. Coral apexes had the highest pHcf and experienced the smallest changes in pHcf in response to acidification. Lateral growth was associated with lower pHcf and greater changes with acidification. Calcification showed a pattern similar to pHcf, with lateral growth being more strongly affected by acidification than apical. Regulation of pHcf is therefore spatially variable within a coral and critical to determining the sensitivity of calcification to ocean acidification." ;

    :description "With respect to their sensitivity to ocean acidification, calcifiers such as the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi have received special attention, as the process of calcification seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in the marine carbonate system. For E. huxleyi, apparently conflicting results regarding its sensitivity to ocean acidification have been published (Iglesias-Rodriguez et al., 2008a; Riebesell et al., 2000). As possible causes for discrepancies, intra-specific variability and different effects of CO2 manipulation methods, i.e. the manipulation of total alkalinity (TA) or total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), have been discussed. While Langer et al. (2009) demonstrate a high degree of intra-specific variability between strains of E. huxleyi, the question whether different CO2 manipulation methods influence the cellular responses has not been resolved yet. In this study, closed TA as well as open and closed DIC manipulation methods were compared with respect to E. huxleyi's CO2-dependence in growth rate, POC- and PIC-production. The differences in the carbonate chemistry between TA and DIC manipulations were shown not to cause any differences in response patterns, while the latter differed between open and closed DIC manipulation. The two strains investigated showed different sensitivities to acidification of seawater, RCC1256 being more negatively affected in growth rates and PIC production than NZEH. " ;

Mussels were exposed to three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.3) and two temperatures (25°C and 30°C) for 14 days. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione (GSH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured in gills and digestive glands after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure. All enzymatic activities were significantly impacted by pH, temperature. Enzymatic activities at the high temperature were significantly higher than those at the low temperature, and the mussels exposed to pH 7.3 showed significantly higher activities than those under higher pH condition for all enzymes except ACP. There was no interaction between temperature and pH in two third of the measured activities suggesting similar mode of action for both drivers. Interaction was only consistently significant for GPX. PCA revealed positive relationships between the measured biochemical indicators in both gills and digestive glands. Overall, our results suggest that decreased pH and increased temperature induce a similar anti-oxidative response in the thick shell mussel." ;

The identification of physiological systems that set the tolerance limits and their potential for phenotypic buffering in the most vulnerable ontogenetic stages become increasingly important to make large-scale projections. Here, we demonstrate that the differential sensitivity of non-calcifying Ambulacraria (echinoderms and hemichordates) larvae towards simulated ocean acidification is dictated by the physiology of their digestive systems. Gastric pH regulation upon experimental ocean acidification was compared in six species of the superphylum Ambulacraria. We observed a strong correlation between sensitivity to ocean acidification and the ability to regulate gut pH. Surprisingly, species with tightly regulated gastric pH were more sensitive to ocean acidification. This study provides evidence that strict maintenance of highly alkaline conditions in the larval gut of Ambulacraria early life stages may dictate their sensitivity to decreases in seawater pH. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and understanding pH regulatory systems in marine larval stages that may contribute to substantial energetic challenges under near-future ocean acidification scenarios." ;

    :description "In order to help predict the effects of anthropogenic stressors on shallow water carbonate environments, it is important to focus research on regions containing natural oceanographic gradients, particularly with respect to interactions between oceanography and ecologically sensitive carbonate producers. The Galápagos Archipelago, an island chain in the eastern equatorial Pacific, spans a natural nutrient, pH, and temperature gradient due to the interaction of several major ocean currents. Further, the region is heavily impacted by the El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Galápagos exhibited widespread coral bleaching and degradation following the strong ENSO events of 1982–1983 and 1997–1998. These findings are coupled with reports of unusually low abundances of time-averaged benthic foraminiferal assemblages throughout the region. Foraminifera, shelled single-celled protists, are sensitive to environmental change and rapidly respond to alterations to their surrounding environment, making them ideal indicator species for the study of reef water quality and health. Here, statistical models and analyses were used to compare modern shallow water benthic foraminiferal assemblages from 19 samples spanning the Galápagos Archipelago to predominant oceanographic parameters at each collection site. Fisher $α$ diversity indices, Ternary diagrams, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, regression tree analysis and FORAM-Index (FI; a single metric index for evaluating water quality associated with reef development) implied a combined impact from ENSO and upwelling from Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) waters to primarily impact foraminiferal abundances and drive assemblage patterns throughout the archipelago. For instance, repeated ENSO temperature anomalies might be responsible for low foraminiferal density, while chronically high nutrients and low aragonite saturation and low pH—induced by EUC upwelling and La Niña anomalies—likely inhibited post-ENSO recovery, and caused foraminiferal assemblages to exhibit a heterotrophic dominance in the southern archipelago. What resulted are low FI values in the southern collection sites, indicating environments not conducive to endosymbiont development and/or recovery." ;

    :description "Anthropogenically-mediated decreases in pH, termed ocean acidification (OA), may be a major threat to marine organisms and communities. Research has focussed mainly on tropical coral reefs, but temperate reefs play a no less important ecological role in colder waters, where OA effects may first be manifest. Here, we report that trends in pH at the surface of three ecologically-important cold-water calcifiers (a primary producer and herbivores), under a range of fluid flows, differ substantially from one another, and for two of the three calcifiers the pH, during darkness, is lower than the mean projected pH due to OA for the surface waters of the global ocean beyond the year 2100. Using micro-optodes, we show that each calcifier had a different pH gradient between its surface and mainstream seawater, i.e. within the diffusion boundary layer which appears to act as an environmental buffer to mainstream pH. Abalone encountered only mainstream seawater pH, whereas pH at the sea urchins' surface was reduced by ̃0.35 units. For coralline algae, pH was \\̃0.5 units higher in the light and \\~̃0.35 units lower under darkness than in ambient mainstream seawater. This wide range of pH within the DBL of some calcifiers will probably affect their performance under projected future reductions in pH due to OA. Differing exposure to a range of surface pH may result in differential susceptibility of calcifiers to OA. Such fluctuations are no doubt regulated by the interplay of water movement, morphology and metabolic rates (e.g. respiration, calcification and/or photosynthesis). Our study, by considering physics (flow regime), chemistry (pH gradients versus OA future projections) and biology (trophic level, physiology and morphology), reveals that predicting species-specific responses and subsequent ecosystem restructuring to OA is complex and requires a holistic, ecomechanical, approach.

    :description "As atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rise, the pH of high-latitude oceans is predicted to decrease by 0.3 to 0.5 units by 2100. Several biological consequences of ocean acidification across this pH range have already been documented in invertebrates and tropical marine fishes. However, little work has been done examining potential responses of the temperate and boreal marine fish species that support major fisheries. In 2 experiments, we examined the growth responses of juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma at ambient and 3 elevated CO2 levels. In a short-term experiment with yearlings, CO2 treatment had no significant effect on growth or condition after 6 wk of rearing. Elevated CO2 levels (\\textgreater450 µatm) increased the rate of otolith deposition, but did not affect otolith elemental composition. In a second experiment, growth in length of sub-yearlings over 12 wk at 8°C was 7.2% faster in the 2 higher CO2 treatments (\\textgreater1200 µatm) than in the lower CO2 treatments (\\textless900 µatm). Growth of sub-yearlings measured during 11 subsequent weeks of rearing at 2.5°C did not differ among CO2 treatments. There was no effect of CO2 treatment on condition factor following either phase of the experiment. Sub-yearling consumption rates were not directly affected by CO2 treatment, confirming that growth at elevated CO2 levels is not maintained through compensatory feeding. While not exhaustive of potential interactive environmental factors, these experiments demonstrate a general resiliency of growth energetics in juvenile walleye pollock to the direct effects of CO2 changes predicted for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea in the next century.

    :description "Multiple aspects of climate change are expected to co-occur such that ocean acidification will take place in conjunction with warming and a range of trophic changes. Previous studies have demonstrated that nutritional condition plays a significant role in the responses of invertebrates to ocean acidification, but similar studies have yet to be conducted with marine fishes. In this study, we examined the potential interactive effects of elevated CO2 levels and nutritional stress on the growth and development of northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra). Separate experiments examined the effects of these two environmental stressors during the pre-flexion (3–31 days) and post-flexion (31–87 days) larval stages. In both stages, the larval feeding regime has a much larger impact on growth rates than did the CO2 level, and there was no observed interaction between stressors. By 31 days post-hatch, larvae in the high-feeding treatment were 84.2% heavier than the fish in the low-feeding treatments, but there was no significant effect of CO2 level on body size or condition. While overall growth rates were faster during the pre-flexion stage, the effects of food limitation were greater for post-flexion larvae undergoing metamorphosis, with the high-feeding treatment fish being 3.3 times as heavy as fish in the low-feeding treatments. These results have important implications for understanding the impacts of the multi-faceted nature of climate change on population productivity of commercial fish species in the North Pacific." ;

    :description "This study investigated the impact of photon flux and elevated CO2 concentrations on growth and photosynthetic electron transport on the marine diatom Chaetoceros muelleri and looked for evidence for the presence of a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). pH drift experiments clearly showed that C. muelleri has the capacity to use bicarbonate to acquire inorganic carbon through one or multiple CCMs. The final pH achieved in unbuffered cultures was not changed by light intensity, even under very low photon flux, implying a low energy demand of bicarbonate use via a CCM. In short-term pH drift experiments, only treatment with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide (EZ) slowed down the rise in pH considerably. EZ was also the only inhibitor that altered the final pH attained, although marginally. In growth experiments, CO2 availability was manipulated by changing the pH in closed flasks at a fixed dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration. Low-light-treated samples showed lower growth rates in elevated CO2 conditions. No CO2 effect was recorded under high light exposure. The maximal photosynthetic capacity, however, increased with CO2 concentration in saturating, but not in subsaturating, light intensities. Growth and photosynthetic capacity therefore responded in opposite ways to increasing CO2 availability. The capacity to photoacclimate to high and low photon flux appeared not to be affected by CO2 treatments. However, photoacclimation was restricted to growth photon fluxes between 30 and 300 µmol photons m−2 s−1. The light saturation points for photosynthetic electron transport and for growth coincided at 100 µmol photons m−2 s−1. Below 100 µmol photons m−2 s−1 the light saturation point for photosynthesis was higher than the growth photon flux (i.e. photosynthesis was not light saturated under growth conditions), whereas at higher growth photon flux, photosynthesis was saturated below growth light levels.

We designed seawater dilution experiments to assess the effect of pCO2 enrichment on heterotrophic bacterial community composition and metabolic potential in response to a pulse of phytoplankton‐derived organic carbon. Experiments included treatments of elevated (1000 ppm) and low (250 ppm) pCO2, amended with 10 $μ$mol L‐1 dissolved organic carbon from Emiliana huxleyi lysates, and were conducted using surface‐seawater collected from the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre. To assess differences in community composition and metabolic potential, shotgun metagenomic libraries were sequenced from low and elevated pCO2 treatments collected at the start of the experiment and following exponential growth. Our results indicate bacterial communities changed markedly in response to the organic matter pulse over time and was significantly affected by pCO2 enrichment. Elevated pCO2 also had disproportionate effects on the abundance of sequences related to proton pumps, carbohydrate metabolism, modifications of the phospholipid bilayer, resistance to toxic compounds and conjugative transfer. These results contribute to a growing understanding of the effects of elevated pCO2 on bacteria‐mediated carbon cycling during phytoplankton bloom conditions in the marine environment." ;

    :description "Despite the heightened awareness of ocean acidification (OA) effects on marine organisms, few studies empirically juxtapose biological responses to CO2 manipulations across functionally distinct primary producers, particularly benthic algae. Algal responses to OA may vary because increasing CO2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra Atoll, simulated OA effects were tested across a suite of ecologically important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for each species independently and metrics were combined from each experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and crustose coralline algae (CCA). The magnitude of the effect of OA on algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was consistent within functional groups. Exposure to OA conditions generally enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in CCA. Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became reproductive upon exposure to OA conditions. There was no consistent effect of OA on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that OA will reduce the ability of calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that CO2 enrichment either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of fleshy macroalgae. Thus, our results suggest that projected OA conditions may favor non-calcifying algae and influence the relative dominance of fleshy macroalgae on reefs, perpetuating or exacerbating existing shifts in reef community structure.

    :description "Turf algal assemblages are ubiquitous primary producers on coral reefs, but little is known about the response of this diverse group to ocean acidification (OA) across different temperatures. We tested the hypothesis that CO2 influences the functional response of epilithic and endolithic turf assemblages to increasing temperature. Replicate carbonate plugs covered by turf were collected from the reef and exposed to ambient and high pCO2 (1000 µatm) conditions for 3 weeks. Each pCO2 treatment was replicated across six temperatures (24.0–31.5 °C) that spanned the full seasonal temperature range on a fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia, and included one warming treatment (3 °C above daily average temperatures). Temperature and CO2 enrichment had complex, and sometimes interactive, effects on turf metabolism and growth. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were enhanced by increasing temperature, with an interactive effect of CO2 enrichment. Photosynthetic rates were amplified by high CO2 in the warmest temperatures, while the increase in respiration rates with temperature were enhanced under ambient CO2. Epilithic turf growth rates were not affected by temperature, but increased in response to CO2 enrichment. We found that CO2 and temperature interactively affected the endolithic assemblage, with the highest growth rates under CO2 enrichment, but only at the warmest temperatures. These results demonstrate how OA may influence algal physiology and growth across a range of ecologically relevant temperatures, and indicate that the effects of CO2 enrichment on coral-reef turf assemblages can be temperature dependent. The complex effects of CO2 enrichment and temperature across a suite of algal responses illustrates the importance of incorporating multiple stressors into global change experiments." ;

    :description "Population outbreaks of the corallivorous crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, are a major contributor to the decline in coral reef across the Indo-Pacific. The success of A. planci and other reef species in a changing ocean will be influenced by juvenile performance because the naturally high mortality experienced at this sensitive life history stage maybe exacerbated by ocean warming and acidification. We investigated the effects of increased temperature and acidification on growth of newly metamorphosed juvenile A. planci and their feeding rates on crustose coralline algae (CCA) during the initial herbivorous phase of their life history. The juveniles were exposed to three temperature (26, 28, 30 °C) and three pH (NIST scale: 8.1, 7.8, 7.6) levels in a flow-through cross-factorial experiment. There were positive but independent effects of warming and acidification on juvenile growth and feeding. Early juveniles were highly tolerant to moderate increases in temperature (+2 °C above ambient) with the highest growth at 30 °C. Growth and feeding rates of A. planci on CCA were highest at pH 7.6. Thus, ocean warming and acidification may enhance the success of A. planci juveniles. In contrast to its coral prey, at this vulnerable developmental stage, A. planci appears to be highly resilient to future ocean change. Success of juveniles in a future ocean may have carry-over effects into the coral-eating life stage, increasing the threat to coral reef systems. " ;

    :description "Even when environmental data quantify the risks and benefits of delayed responses to rapid anthropogenic change, institutions rarely respond promptly. We propose that narratives complementing environmental datasets can motivate responsive environmental policy. To explore this idea, we relate a case study in which a narrative of economic loss due to regionally rapid ocean acidification-an anthropogenic change-helped connect knowledge with action. We pose three hypotheses to explain why narratives might be particularly effective in linking science to environmental policy, drawing from the literature of economics, environmental policy, and cognitive psychology. It seems that yet-untold narratives may hold similar potential for strengthening the feedback between environmental data and policy and motivating regional responses to other environmental problems." ;

    :description "Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is widely used to disinfect seawater in power plant cooling systems in order to reduce biofouling, and in ballast water treatment systems to prevent transport of exotic marine species. While the toxicity of NaOCl is expected to increase by ongoing ocean acidification, and many experimental studies have shown how algal calcification, photosynthesis and growth respond to ocean acidification, no studies have investigated the relationship between NaOCl toxicity and increased CO2. Therefore, we investigated whether the impacts of NaOCl on survival, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and effective quantum yield in three marine phytoplankton belonging to different taxonomic classes are increased under high CO2 levels. Our results show that all biological parameters of the three species decreased under increasing NaOCl concentration, but increasing CO2 concentration alone (from 450 to 715 $μ$atm) had no effect on any of these parameters in the organisms. However, due to the synergistic effects between NaOCl and CO2, the survival and Chl-a content in two of the species, Thalassiosira eccentrica and Heterosigma akashiwo, were significantly reduced under high CO2 when NaOCl was also elevated. The results show that combined exposure to high CO2 and NaOCl results in increasing toxicity of NaOCl in some marine phytoplankton. Consequently, greater caution with use of NaOCl will be required, as its use is widespread in coastal waters.  " ;

    :description "Deep-sea species are generally thought to be less tolerant of environmental variation than shallow-living species due to the relatively stable conditions in deep waters for most parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH). To explore the potential for deep-sea hermit crabs (Pagurus tanneri) to acclimate to future ocean acidification, we compared their olfactory and metabolic performance under ambient (pH ∼7.6) and expected future (pH ∼7.1) conditions. After exposure to reduced pH waters, metabolic rates of hermit crabs increased transiently and olfactory behaviour was impaired, including antennular flicking and prey detection. Crabs exposed to low pH treatments exhibited higher individual variation for both the speed of antennular flicking and speed of prey detection, than observed in the control pH treatment, suggesting that phenotypic diversity could promote adaptation to future ocean acidification.

    :description "The ocean is a substantial sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) released as a result of human activities. Over the coming decades the dissolved inorganic C concentration in the surface ocean is predicted to increase, which is expected to have a direct influence on the efficiency of C utilization (consumption and production) by phytoplankton during photosynthesis. Here, we evaluated the generality of C‐rich organic matter production by examining the elemental C:N ratio of organic matter produced under conditions of varying pCO2. The data used in this analysis were obtained from a series of pelagic in situ pCO2 perturbation studies that were performed in the diverse ocean regions and involved natural phytoplankton assemblages. The C:N ratio of the resulting particulate and dissolved organic matter did not differ across the range of pCO2 conditions tested. In particular, the ratio for particulate organic C and N was found to be 6.58 ± 0.05, close to the theoretical value of 6.6." ;

    :description "Anthropogenic nutrient inputs enhance microbial respiration within many coastal ecosystems, driving concurrent hypoxia and acidification. During photosynthesis, Symbiodinium spp., the microalgal endosymbionts of cnidarians and other marine phyla, produce O2 and assimilate CO2 , and thus potentially mitigate the exposure of the host to these stresses. However, such a role for Symbiodinium remains untested for non-calcifying cnidarians. We therefore contrasted the fitness of symbiotic and aposymbiotic polyps of a model host jellyfish (Cassiopea sp.) under reduced O2 (̃2.09mgL(-1) ) and pH (\\̃pH 7.63) scenarios in a full factorial experiment. Host fitness was characterised as asexual reproduction and their ability to regulate internal pH and Symbiodinium performance characterised by maximum photochemical efficiency, chla content, and cell density. Acidification alone resulted in 58% more asexual reproduction of symbiotic polyps than aposymbiotic polyps (and enhanced Symbiodinium cell density) suggesting Cassiopea sp. fitness was enhanced by CO2 -stimulated Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity. Indeed, greater CO2 drawdown (elevated pH) was observed within host tissues of symbiotic polyps under acidification regardless of O2 conditions. Hypoxia alone produced 22% fewer polyps than ambient conditions regardless of acidification and symbiont status, suggesting Symbiodinium photosynthetic activity did not mitigate its effects. Combined hypoxia and acidification, however, produced similar numbers of symbiotic polyps compared with aposymbiotic kept under ambient conditions, demonstrating that the presence of Symbiodinium was key for mitigating the combined effects of hypoxia and acidification on asexual reproduction. We hypothesise that this mitigation occurred because of reduced photorespiration under elevated CO2 conditions where increased net O2 production ameliorates oxygen debt. We show that Symbiodinium play an important role in facilitating enhanced fitness of Cassiopea sp. polyps, and perhaps also other non-calcifying cnidarian hosts, to the ubiquitous effects of ocean acidification. Importantly we highlight that symbiotic, non-calcifying cnidarians may be particularly advantaged in productive coastal waters that are subject to simultaneous hypoxia and acidification.

    :description "Kelp forests are among the world's most productive marine ecosystems, yet little is known about their biogeochemistry. This study presents a 14-month time series (July 2013–August 2014) of surface and benthic dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity measurements, along with accompanying hydrographic measurements, from six locations within a central California kelp forest. We present ranges and patterns of variability in carbonate chemistry, including pH (7.70–8.33), pCO2 (172–952 µatm), and the aragonite saturation state, $Ømega$Ar (0.94–3.91). Surface-to-bottom gradients in CO2 system chemistry were as large as the spatial gradients throughout the bottom of the kelp forest. Dissolved inorganic carbon variability was the main driver of the observed CO2 system variability. The majority of spatial variability in the kelp forest can be explained by advection of cold, dense high-CO2 waters into the bottom of the kelp forest, with deeper sites experiencing high-CO2 conditions more frequently. Despite the strong imprint of advection on the biogeochemical variability of the kelp forest, surface waters were undersaturated with CO2 in the spring through fall, indicative of the strong role of photosynthesis on biogeochemical variability. We emphasize the importance of spatially distributed measurements for developing a process-based understanding of kelp forest ecosystem function in a changing climate. " ;

    :description "Ocean acidification threatens many marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers. The only global‐scale solution to ocean acidification remains rapid reduction in CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, interest in localized mitigation strategies has grown rapidly because of the recognized threat ocean acidification imposes on natural communities, including ones important to humans. Protection of seagrass meadows has been considered as a possible approach for localized mitigation of ocean acidification due to their large standing stocks of organic carbon and high productivity. Yet much work remains to constrain the magnitudes and timescales of potential buffering effects from seagrasses. We developed a biogeochemical box model to better understand the potential for a temperate seagrass meadow to locally mitigate the effects of ocean acidification. Then we parameterized the model using data from Tomales Bay, an inlet on the coast of California, USA which supports a major oyster farming industry. We conducted a series of month‐long model simulations to characterize processes that occur during summer and winter. We found that average pH in the seagrass meadows was typically within 0.04 units of the pH of the primary source waters into the meadow, although we did find occasional periods (hours) when seagrass metabolism may modify the pH by up to ±0.2 units. Tidal phasing relative to the diel cycle modulates localized pH buffering within the seagrass meadow such that maximum buffering occurs during periods of the year with midday low tides. Our model results suggest that seagrass metabolism in Tomales Bay would not provide long‐term ocean acidification mitigation. However, we emphasize that our model results may not hold in meadows where assumptions about depth‐averaged net production and seawater residence time within the seagrass meadow differ from our model assumptions. Our modeling approach provides a framework that is easily adaptable to other seagrass meadows in order to evaluate the extent of their individual buffering capacities. Regardless of their ability to buffer ocean acidification, seagrass meadows maintain many critically important ecosystem goods and services that will be increasingly important as humans increasingly affect coastal ecosystems." ;

    :description "Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions simultaneously increase ocean temperatures and reduce ocean surface pH, a process termed ocean acidification (OA). OA is expected to negatively affect the growth and physiology of many calcified organisms, but the response of non-calcified (fleshy) organisms is less well understood. Rising temperatures and pCO2 can enhance photosynthetic rates (within tolerance limits). Therefore, warming may interact with OA to alter biological responses of macroalgae in complicated ways. Beyond thresholds of physiological tolerance, however, rising temperatures could further exacerbate negative responses to OA. Many studies have investigated the effects of OA or warming independently of each other, but few studies have quantified the interactive effects of OA and warming on marine organisms. We conducted four short-term independent factorial CO2 enrichment and warming experiments on six common species of calcified and fleshy macroalgae from southern California to investigate the independent and interactive effects of CO2 and warming on growth, carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme activity, pigment concentrations, and photosynthetic efficiency. There was no effect of elevated pCO2 on CA activity, pigment concentration, and photosynthetic efficiency in the macroalgal species studies. However, we found that calcareous algae suffered reduced growth rates under high pCO2 conditions alone, although the magnitude of the effect varied by species. Fleshy algae had mixed responses of growth rates to high pCO2, indicating that the effects of pCO2 enrichment are inconsistent across species. The combined effects of elevated pCO2 and warming had a significantly negative impact on growth for both fleshy and calcareous algae; calcareous algae experienced five times more weight loss than specimens in ambient control conditions and fleshy growth was reduced by 76%. Our results demonstrate the need to study the interactive effects of multiple stressors associated with global change on marine communities. " ;

    :description "This study demonstrated that the increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in seawater and the attendant acidification that are projected to occur by the year 2300 will severely impact the early development of the oyster Crassostrea gigas. Eggs of the oyster were artificially fertilized and incubated for 48 h in seawater acidified to pH 7.4 by equilibrating it with CO2-enriched air (CO2 group), and the larval morphology and degree of shell mineralization were compared with the control treatment (air-equilibrated seawater). Only 5% of the CO2 group developed into normal ?D-shaped? veliger larvae as compared with 68% in the control group, although no difference was observed between the groups up to the trochophore stage. Thus, during embryogenesis, the calcification process appears to be particularly affected by low pH and/or the low CaCO3 saturation state of high-CO2 seawater. Veliger larvae with fully mineralized shells accounted for 30% of the CO2-group larvae, compared with 72% in the control (p \\textless 0.005). Shell mineralization was completely inhibited in 45% of the CO2-group larvae, but only in 16% of the control (p \\textless 0.05). Normal D-shaped veligers of the control group exhibited increased shell length and height between 24 and 48 h after fertilization, while the few D-shaped veligers of the CO2 group showed no shell growth during the same period. Our results suggest that future ocean acidification will have deleterious impacts on the early development of marine benthic calcifying organisms." ;

During adulthood, cell proliferation is fundamental for fish brain growth and for it to adapt in response to external stimuli, such as environmental changes. Here we report the first expression study of genes regulating neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in brains of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), cinnamon anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus) and spiny damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) exposed to elevated CO2 The mRNA expression levels of the neurogenic differentiation factor (NeuroD) and doublecortin (DCX) were upregulated in three-spined stickleback exposed to high-CO2 compared with controls, while no changes were detected in the other species. The mRNA expression levels of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) remained unaffected in the high-CO2 exposed groups compared to the control in all three species. These results indicate a species-specific regulation of genes involved in neurogenesis in response to elevated ambient CO2 levels. The higher expression of NeuroD and DCX mRNA transcripts in the brain of high-CO2-exposed three-spined stickleback, together with the lack of effects on mRNA levels in cinnamon anemonefish and spiny damselfish, indicate differences in coping mechanisms among fish in response to the predicted-future CO2 level." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA), attributed to the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into the surface ocean, and coastal eutrophication, attributed in part to land-use change and terrestrial runoff of fertilizers, have received recent attention in an experimental framework examining the effects of each on coral reef net ecosystem calcification (Gnet). However, OA and eutrophication in conjunction have yet to receive attention from the perspective of coral reef sediment dissolution. To address this omission, CO2 and nitrate (NO3−) addition experiments were performed in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Incubation chambers were used to measure sediment Gnet during the day and night under three different [NO3−] (0, 9.8, and 19.7 $μ$M) that were nested within four separate constructed coral reef communities maintained at different PCO2 levels (417, 721, 1030, and 1333 $μ$atm, respectively). PCO2 negatively affected sediment Gnet during the day and night, resulting in a shift to diel net dissolution at a PCO2 of 1030 $μ$atm. Elevated NO3− alone, and the combination of NO3− and PCO2, both negatively affected sediment Gnet at night. However, the response of Gnet to NO3− was less clear during the day, where diurnal sediment Gnet was enhanced under the combined treatment of elevated NO3− and PCO2, resulting in no net effect of NO3− on sediment Gnet on diel timescales. Overall, these results show that ocean acidification represents a greater threat to the balance of calcification and dissolution in Mo'orea's back reef sediment communities than the potential impact of NO3− enrichment on relatively short timescales." ;

    :description "The absorption of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans is causing a reduction in the pH of the surface waters termed ocean acidification (OA). This could have substantial effects on marine coastal environments where fleshy (non-calcareous) macroalgae are dominant primary producers and ecosystem engineers. Few OA studies have focused on the early life stages of large macroalgae such as kelps. This study evaluated the effects of seawater pH on the ontogenic development of meiospores of the native kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida, in south-eastern New Zealand. Meiospores of both kelps were released into four seawater pH treatments (pHT 7.20, extreme OA predicted for 2300; pHT 7.65, OA predicted for 2100; pHT 8.01, ambient pH; and pHT 8.40, pre-industrial pH) and cultured for 15 d. Meiospore germination, germling growth rate, and gametophyte size and sex ratio were monitored and measured. Exposure to reduced pHT (7.20 and 7.65) had positive effects on germling growth rate and gametophyte size in both M. pyrifera and U. pinnatifida, whereas, higher pHT (8.01 and 8.40) reduced the gametophyte size in both kelps. Sex ratio of gametophytes of both kelps was biased towards females under all pHT treatments, except for U. pinnatifida at pHT 7.65. Germling growth rate under OA was significantly higher in M. pyrifera compared to U. pinnatifida but gametophyte development was equal for both kelps under all seawater pHT treatments, indicating that the microscopic stages of the native M. pyrifera and the invasive U. pinnatifida will respond similarly to OA.

Discharges of heavy metals, BOD, COD, organic/inorganic nitrogen, and phosphorous have, as a result, caused environmental problems. Besides pollutants brought by long-range transport such as dust storms, haze, and water-borne radiation, locally sourced pollutants were transported to the coastal area by small mountain rivers on the narrow island. This has become a great problem for the coastal environment and a threat to both riverine and coastal organisms. Knowledge about these anthropogenic substances has been increasing due to improved analytical technology and concern has been increasing due to the adverse health effects that are being identified. Therefore, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, radioactive substances, and many emerging contaminants have become new targets for investigation in recent years in the coastal areas where they end up. Their potential risks to the ecosystems have been confirmed, but there are still no relevant regulations for their prevention. Furthermore, there will be more new chemicals that will cause concern in the future. This chapter focuses on these issues as well as on several contaminants that should be investigated further in Taiwan's coastal environment." ;

Simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under low, medium and high emissions scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 respectively) are then used to project how ocean acidification and sea surface temperature will change. Under each of these emissions scenarios the oceans around Austral-ia exhibit warming and continued acidification. However, these changes are quite heterogeneous, with increases of up to +6 K (under RCP 8.5) above the pre-industrial value, projected in areas such as the Tasman Sea. We conclude that the projected changes in SST, aragonite saturation state and pH are likely to profoundly impact marine ecosystems, and the ecosystem services that they provide in the Australasian region." ;

    :description "The CO2-boosted trophic transfer from primary producers to herbivores has been increasingly discovered at natural CO2 vents and in laboratory experiments. Despite the emerging knowledge of this boosting effect, we do not know the extent to which it may be enhanced or dampened by ocean warming. We investigated whether ocean acidification and warming enhance the nutritional quality (C:N ratio) and energy content of turf algae, which is speculated to drive higher feeding rate, greater energy budget and eventually faster growth of herbivores. This proposal was tested by observing the physiological (feeding rate, respiration rate and energy budget) and demographic responses (growth and survival) of a common grazing gastropod (Phasianella australis) to ocean acidification and warming in a 6-month mesocosm experiment. Whilst we observed the boosting effect of ocean acidification and warming in isolation on the energy budget of herbivores by either increasing feeding rate on the more nutritious algae or increasing energy gain per feeding effort, their growth and survival were reduced by the sublethal thermal stress under ocean warming, especially when both climate change stressors were combined. This reduced growth and survival occurred as a consequence of depleted energy reserves, suggesting that the boosting effect via trophic transfer might not sufficiently compensate for the increased energy demand imposed by ocean warming. In circumstances where ocean acidification and warming create an energy demand on herbivores that outweighs the energy enhancement of their food (i.e. primary producers), the performance of herbivores to control their blooming resources likely deteriorates and thus runaway primary production ensues.

In the present study, we investigated the morphology and classification of hemocytes in the pearl oyster, P. fucata. Three types of hemocytes were successfully obtained by light microscopy, electron microscopy and flow cytometry methods: small hyalinocytes, large hyalinocytes and granulocytes. The small hyalinocytes are the major hemocyte population. Morphological analyses indicated that these hemocytes have species-specific characterizations. In addition, we assessed the potential effects of ocean acidification (OA) and ocean warming (OW) on the immune parameters and calcium homeostasis of the hemocytes. OA and OW (31°C) altered pH value of hemolymph, increased the total hemocyte count, total protein content, and percentage of large hyalinocytes and granulocytes, while it decreased the neutral red uptake ability, suggesting active stress responses of P. fucata to these stressors. Exposure to OW (25 °C) resulted in no significant differences, indicating an excellent immune defense to heat stress at this level. The outflow of calcium from hemocytes to hemolymph was also determined, implying the potential impact of OA and OW on hemocyte-mediated biomineralization. This study, therefore, provides insight into the classification and characterization of hemocyte in the pearl oyster, P. fucata, and also reveals the immune responses of hemocytes to OA and OW, which are helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of global climate change on pearl oysters." ;

Our results demonstrated that neither [HCOˉ3], DIC, or pH ([H+]) were determining factors for the shellfish calcification rate of blue mussel or Zhikong scallop. However, a significant correlation was detected between calcification rate and DIC/[H+] and [CO32ˉ] in both species." ;

    :description "Ulva spp., an increasingly important food, are the dominant species of the large-scale green tides. In this study, both the growth and the physiological responses of the Ulva prolifera were studied after cultured in three different light and dark regimes (12:12, 14:10 and 16:8-h light/dark) in combination with current (420 $μ$atm; LC) and increased (1000 $μ$atm; HC) levels of atmospheric CO2. Grown rate of U. prolifera was significantly enhanced by increased CO2 under the three light:dark regimes, especially under 16:8 h-light:dark, indicating that growth was C-unsaturated at present CO2 levels. U. prolifera showed a significantly higher growth rate and lower dark respiration rate (Rd) at 16:8 h-light:dark treatment than at 12:12 h-light/dark treatment, regardless of the CO2 treatment. The photochemical performance was largely unaffected by elevated CO2 and daylength. These results suggest that U. prolifera in a future CO2 enriched coastal water, seems to be resilient to higher CO2 concentrations, and this could be enhanced by longer daylength." ;

    :description "To test the effects of chronic stress caused by CO2-driven decreases in pH (NBS scale) on molluscs, juvenile Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), an economically important gastropod, were cultured at pH 8.1 (control), pH 7.9 or 7.7 for 3 months. Eroded shell surfaces, reduced growth rates, and altered biochemical composition and energy metabolism were found in abalone cultured in acidified conditions. Glycogen contents and crude lipid contents were significantly higher in the muscle of abalone from the control treatments than in those from the pH 7.7 treatment, indicating that allocation of tissue energy storage was altered by chronic acidification. The ratio of the oxygen consumption rate to the ammonia excretion rate (O:N ratio) of individuals cultured at two acidified treatments decreased significantly compared with the controls, suggesting a decreased use of body lipid and carbohydrates as a metabolic substrate under chronic acidified conditions. Chronic acidification had detrimental effects on the physiological activity of the Pacific abalone; however, the ability to acclimate varied among individuals. A minority of tested animals incubated at acidified conditions exhibited undiminished performance. The Pacific abalone may face severe challenges in the near future, but they may also hold considerable ability to acclimate to ocean acidification." ;

    :description "The North Yellow Sea (NYS) is a western North Pacific marginal sea of major ecological and economic importance, where seasonal thermocline and subsurface cold water mass are well developed from spring to autumn. Earlier researchers have shown monthly/bimonthly declines of pH ($Δ$pH) and aragonite saturation state ($Δ$$Ømega$arag) in the NYS cold water mass. To quantify the biogeochemical processes controlling these variations, we applied a systematic decomposition methodology to $Δ$$Ømega$arag and $Δ$pH values, using the Redfield ratio and published data sets of NYS carbonate and ancillary parameters for 2011 and 2013. Results show that the contributions of the NYS cold water mass community respiration ($Δ$$Ømega$Resp), calcification ($Δ$$Ømega$Calc) and temperature changes ($Δ$$Ømega$$Δ$T) to the monthly $Δ$$Ømega$arag from spring to summer were 84±9%, 30±16%, and −13±10%, while the $Δ$$Ømega$Resp, $Δ$$Ømega$$Δ$T and contributions of CaCO3 dissolution ($Δ$$Ømega$Diss) to the bimonthly $Δ$$Ømega$arag from late summer to autumn were 103%, 1% and −5%. Meanwhile, the contributions of the NYS cold water mass community respiration ($Δ$pHResp), temperature changes ($Δ$pH$Δ$T) and calcification ($Δ$pHCalc) to the monthly $Δ$pH from spring to summer were 50±23%, 39±23%, and 13±4%, while the $Δ$pHResp, $Δ$pH$Δ$T and contributions of CaCO3 dissolution ($Δ$pHDiss) to the bimonthly $Δ$pH from late summer to autumn were 110%, −5%, and −5%. Our results suggest that the NYS cold water mass net calcification rate declines to nearly zero when $Ømega$arag reaches a critical level of 1.5−1.6. Using a future scenario to predict the impacts of rising atmospheric CO2 levels on seasonal variations of $Ømega$arag and pH values, we show that very low $Ømega$arag values of \\textless1.5 may exist all year round in the NYS subsurface waters by the 2050 s, while aragonite undersaturated water ($Ømega$arag \\textless1) may appear in autumn months, causing great stress to its benthic faunal community." ;

Here, we examine the effects of elevated CO2 on the bacterioplankton community during a mesocosm experiment using an artificial phytoplankton community in subtropical, eutrophic coastal waters of Xiamen, southern China. Through sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region, we found that the bacterioplankton community in this high-nutrient coastal environment was relatively resilient to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. Based on comparative ecological network analysis, we found that elevated CO2 hardly altered the network structure of high-abundance bacterioplankton taxa but appeared to reassemble the community network of low abundance taxa. This led to relatively high resilience of the whole bacterioplankton community to the elevated CO2 level and associated chemical changes. We also observed that the Flavobacteria group, which plays an important role in the microbial carbon pump, showed higher relative abundance under the elevated CO2 condition during the early stage of the phytoplankton bloom in the mesocosms. Our results provide new insights into how elevated CO2 may influence bacterioplankton community structure." ;

    :description "Increased CO2 and associated acidification in seawater, known as ocean acidification, decreases calcification of most marine calcifying organisms. However, there is little information available on how marine macroalgae would respond to the chemical changes caused by seawater acidification. We hypothesized that down-regulation of bicarbonate acquisition by algae under increased acidity and CO2 levels would lower the threshold above which photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) becomes excessive. Juveniles of Ulva prolifera derived from zoospores were grown at ambient (390 µatm) and elevated (1000 µatm) CO2 concentrations for 80 days before the hypothesis was tested. Here, the CO2-induced seawater acidification increased the quantum yield under low levels of light, but induced higher nonphotochemical quenching under high light. At the same time, the PAR level at which photosynthesis became saturated was decreased and the photosynthetic affinity for CO2 or inorganic carbon decreased in the high-CO2 grown plants. These findings indicated that ocean acidification, as an environmental stressor, can reduce the threshold above which PAR becomes excessive.  " ;

    :description "Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide results in a decrease in seawater pH, a process known as “ocean acidification”. The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, the noble scallop Chlamys nobilis, and the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis are species of economic and ecological importance along the southern coast of China. We evaluated the effects of seawater acidification on clearance, respiration, and excretion rates in these three species. The ammals were reared in seawater at pH 8.1 (control), 7.7, or 7.4. The clearance rate was highest at pH 7.7 for P. fucata and at pH 8.1 for C. nobilis and P. viridis. The pH had little effect on the respiration rate of P. fucata and P. viridis. In contrast, the respiration rate was significantly lower at pH 7.4 in C. nobilis. The excretion rate was significantly lower at pH 7.4 than pH 8.1 for all species. The results indicate that the reduction in seawater pH likely affected the metabolic process (food intake, oxygen consumption, and ammonia excretion) of these bivalves. Different species respond differently to seawater acidification. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the exact mechamsms for this effect and evaluate adaptability of these bivalves to future acidified oceans.  " ;

    :description "Skeletal growth records in annually banded massive coral skeletons are an under-exploited archive of coral responses to environmental changes. Average linear extension and calcification rates in Indo-Pacific Porites are linearly related to average water temperatures through 23 to 30¯C. Assessing long-term trends in Porites extension and density requires caution as there is evidence of an age effect whereby in earlier growth years corals will tend to extend less and form a higher density skeleton than in later years. This does not appear to affect calcification rates. Coral growth characteristics at 2 of 3 reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef provide evidence of a recent decline. This is of concern, although the exact causes cannot be identified. International efforts are required to make full use of both coral growth histories and geochemical tracers contained in massive coral skeletons to understand the nature and significance of recent trends and their possible links with environmental changes such as ocean chemistry, warming tropical oceans and increased frequency of coral bleaching events." ;

    :description "Cryptic colouration in crustaceans, important for both camouflage and visual communication, is achieved through physiological and morphological mechanisms that are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Consequently, ocean warming and ocean acidification can affect crustaceans' biophotonic appearance and exoskeleton composition in ways that might disrupt colouration and transparency. In the present study, we measured growth, mineralization, transparency, and spectral reflectance (colouration) of the caridean grass shrimp Hippolyte californiensis in response to pH and temperature stressors. Shrimp were exposed to ambient pH and temperature (pH 8.0, 17 °C), decreased pH (pH 7.5, 17 °C), and decreased pH/increased temperature (pH 7.5, 19 °C) conditions for 7 weeks. There were no differences in either Mg or Ca content in the exoskeleton across treatments nor in the transparency and spectral reflectance. There was a small but significant increase in percent growth in the carapace length of shrimp exposed to decreased pH/increased temperature. Overall, these findings suggest that growth, calcification, and colour of H. californiensis are unaffected by decreases of 0.5 pH units. This tolerance might stem from adaptation to the highly variable pH environment that these grass shrimp inhabit, highlighting the multifarious responses to ocean acidification, within the Crustacea." ;

Observations show that five time series data sets worldwide, with observation times from 9 to 23 years, have yielded $β$pH values that vary from 1.61 × 10−3 to −2.5 × 10−3 pH unit yr−1. After correcting for the deviation, these data now all yield an acidification rate similar to what is expected under the air-sea CO2 equilibrium (−1.6 × 10−3 ̃ −1.8 × 10−3 pH unit yr−1). Although long-term time series stations may have evenly distributed datasets, shorter time series may suffer large errors which are correctable by this method." ;

    :description "In the mid-2000s the U.S. west coast oyster industry experienced several years of significant production failures. This industry has been referred to as the “canary in a coal mine” for ocean acidification (OA). Industry-led collaboration with university and government scientists identified a relationship between elevated carbon dioxide in seawater and poor oyster seed production. This multiyear production slow-down resulted in significant economic losses to the industry and spurred state and regionally led initiatives to examine the current and potential future impacts of OA. To examine the perceptions and understanding of OA by the U.S. west coast shellfish industry, a regional survey of the industry was conducted, covering oyster, mussel, clam, geoduck, and abalone producers. The web-based survey addressed four general areas: experience, understanding, concern, and adaptability. There were 86 total respondents from industry, resulting in a response rate of 46% with 96% of respondents answering all 44 questions. Seventy percent of respondents were owners or managers of a shellfish business. Findings from the survey indicate that approximately half of the industry had personally experienced a negative impact from OA. This personal experience generally led to a higher level of concern about OA; however, self-reported level of understanding of OA resulted in slightly less concordance with the level of concern. Greater than 80% of the shellfish industry noted that OA will have consequences today, approximately four times higher than the U.S. public's perception of the threat. Finally, greater than 50% of the industry felt that they would be able to somewhat or definitely adapt to OA." ;

The system is ideally suited to long-term experimental studies of the effect of acidification on biological processes involving small-bodied (10–20 mm) calcifying or non-calcifying organisms. Using hobbyist-grade equipment, the system was constructed for approximately USD 1200 per treatment unit (tank, pH regulation apparatus, chiller, pump/filter unit). An overall tolerance of ±0.05 pHT units (SD) was achieved over 90 days in two acidified treatments (7.60 and 7.40) at 12 °C using glass electrodes calibrated with synthetic seawater buffers, thereby preventing liquid junction error. The performance of the system was validated through the independent calculation of pHT (12 °C) using dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity data taken from discrete acidified seawater samples. The system was used to compare the shell growth of the marine gastropod Zeacumantus subcarinatus infected with the trematode parasite Maritrema novaezealandensis with that of uninfected snails at pH levels of 7.4, 7.6, and 8.1.

Strategies to manage natural resources are often not effective, or do not have intended outcomes, if they do not account for local contexts and the varied needs and constraints of stakeholders who rely upon natural resources for their livelihoods. Through fieldwork in Ba, Fiji, local insights were generated concerning the institutional, geographic, and socio-economic factors which determine and challenge i) different stakeholders' ability to access landscape resources, and ii) stakeholders' capacities to benefit from ecosystem services. The following insights were generated from this research which are important for guiding management of landscape multifunctionality. In Ba, hierarchical governance systems present barriers to effective management of landscape multifunctionality, and projects or policies with aims to manage landscapes should establish context appropriate multi-scale governance. Such governance systems should facilitate communication and interaction between different stakeholders, build upon community knowledge, and support communities as key actors in landscape management. Consideration of the spatial footprint of landscape resources, stakeholders' different physical and financial capacities, and the institutional structures that mediate access to resources should be central to landscape management and planning. Various climatic stressors affect flows of ecosystem services from the Ba landscape and people's capacity to access landscape resources; therefore, it is important that management of landscapes also builds resilience to climate stressors." ;

    :description "Anthropogenic CO2 is causing warming and ocean acidification. Coral reefs are being severely impacted, yet confusion lingers regarding how reefs will respond to these stressors over this century. Since the 1982-83 El Niño-Southern Oscillation warming event, the persistence of reefs around the Galápagos Islands has differed across an acidification gradient. Reefs disappeared where pH \\textless 8.0 and aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$arag) ≤ 3 and have not recovered, whereas one reef has persisted where pH \\textgreater 8.0 and $Ømega$arag \\textgreater 3. Where upwelling is greatest, calcification by massive Porites is higher than predicted by a published relationship with temperature despite high CO2, possibly due to elevated nutrients. However, skeletal P/Ca, a proxy for phosphate exposure, negatively correlates with density (R = -0.822, p \\textless 0.0001). We propose that elevated nutrients have the potential to exacerbate acidification by depressing coral skeletal densities and further increasing bioerosion already accelerated by low pH." ;

    :description "Exposure of the toxigenic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella to variations in pCO2/pH, comparable to current and near-future levels observed in Southern Chilean fjords, revealed potential functional adaptation mechanisms. Under calculated conditions for pH(total scale) and pCO2 ranging from 7.73–8.66 to 69.7–721.3 $μ$atm, respectively, the Chilean strain Q09 presented an optimum growth rate and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake at near-equilibrium pCO2/pH conditions (∼8.1). DistaLM analysis between physiological relevant carbonate system parameters (CO2, HCO−3, and H+) and cellular rates (growth rate and DIC uptake) identified HCO−3 as the unique variable explaining a significant portion of the physiological response. Estimations of equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) and chain-formation index (CI) revealed reduced cell size and enhanced chain formation at high pH/low pCO2 conditions. Light intensity as co-factor during experiments (50 vs. 100 $μ$mol photons m−2 s−1) produced no effect on ESD and CI. Cells exposed to low light; however, had reduced cell growth and DIC uptake especially at high pH/low pCO2. We suggest that A. catenella Chilean strains are highly adapted to spatio-temporal pCO2/pH fluctuations in Chilean fjords, becoming a resilient winner from expected climate change effects. " ;

Areas covered included the eastern part portion of the lagoon from the airport to Uliga in the east , the inner margin of the lagoon and the northern margin from Calalin channel to Rita. A single reconnaissance multibeam line was also completed along the lagoon reef slope of the western margin of the atoll. Seismic information and data on the physical properties of the water were collected concurrently. 
Together with previous survey data were plotted onto high resolution IKONS satellite imagery to show the effects of past dredgings. Data collected was used to produce bathymetry maps and are available here in PDF formats for download with appropriate permission from the SOPAC secretariat.

    :description "Ocean acidification driven by absorption of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is now recognized as a systemic, global process that could threaten diverse marine ecosystems and a number of commercially important species. The change in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral saturation states (omega) brought on by the reduction of seawater pH is most pronounced in high latitude regions where unique biogeochemical processes create an environment more susceptible to the suppression of omega values for aragonite and calcite, which are critical to shell building organisms. New observations from the eastern Bering Sea shelf show that remineralization of organic matter exported from surface waters rapidly increases bottom water CO2 concentrations over the shelf in summer and fall, suppressing omega values. The removal of CO2 from surface waters by high rates of phytoplankton primary production increases omega values between spring and summer, but these increases are partly counteracted by mixing with sea ice melt water and terrestrial river runoff that have low omega values. While these environmental processes play an important role in creating seasonally low saturation states, ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has shifted omega values for aragonite to below the saturation horizon in broad regions across the shelf for at least several months each year. Furthermore, we also report that calcite became undersaturated in September of 2009 in the bottom waters over the shelf. The reduction in CaCO3 mineral saturation states could have profound implications for several keystone calcifying species in the Bering Sea, particularly the commercially important crab fisheries.

    :description "The California Undercurrent transports Pacific Equatorial Water (PEW) into the Southern California Bight from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. PEW is characterized by higher temperatures and salinities, with lower pH, representing a source of potentially corrosive (aragonite, inline image) water to the region. We use ichthyoplankton assemblages near the cores of the California Current and the California Undercurrent to determine whether PEW influenced fish diversity. We use hydrographic data to characterize the interannual and seasonal variability of estimated pH and aragonite saturation with depth. Although there is substantial variability in PEW presence as measured by spice on the 26.25–26.75 isopycnal layer, as well as in pH and aragonite saturation, we found fish diversity to be stable over the decades 1985–1996 and 1999–2011. We detected significant difference in species structure during the 1998 La Niña period, due to reduced species evenness. Species richness due to rare species was higher during the 1997/1998 El Niño compared to the La Niña but the effect on species structure was undetectable. Lack of difference in the species abundance structure in the decade before and after the 1997/1999 ENSO event showed that the assemblage reverted to its former structure following the ENSO perturbation, indicating resilience. While the interdecadal species structure remained stable, the long tail of the distributions shows that species richness increased between the decades consistent with intrusion of warm water with more diverse assemblages into the southern California region." ;

    :description "As typical of intertidal invertebrates the asterinid seastar Parvulastra exigua experiences marked variation in environmental temperature and pH/pCO2 due to tidal exchange and diurnal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration. We characterized the temperature and pH/pCO2 conditions in the mid-intertidal, rocky-shore habitat of this species and used these data along with projections for the ocean over coming decades to define treatments in oxygen consumption experiments. The metabolic response of P. exigua to warming and acidification was dominated by temperature as the most significant factor influencing oxygen consumption. When P. exigua were exposed to intermediate pH/pCO2 (7.8 /≈ 750 ppm) levels combined with pulses of warming occasionally experienced in nature (6 °C above sea surface temperature), the effect of temperature on metabolism was diminished. Our results show that the metabolic response of P. exigua is resilient to current levels of stress, but may be vulnerable in the future to the interactive effects of ocean warming and acidification at levels expected under near-future climate change.

    :description "Shoaling of the saturation horizon for aragonite in the California Current System has been well-documented; however, these reports are based primarily on surveys conducted in waters off the continental shelf. Here we characterize, for the first time, regional spatial and seasonal patterns in aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$arag) in the shallow, nearshore waters of the southern California continental shelf through a series of synoptic surveys. Spectrophotometric pH and total alkalinity samples were collected quarterly from 72 sites along the shelf for two years. Samples were collected using Niskin bottles deployed at 2–3 depths per station (surface, mixed layer, and near-bottom) to characterize site extremes in $Ømega$arag (highest values near the surface, lowest at depth). $Ømega$arag in bottle samples ranged between 3.0 and 0.54 and was strongly associated with density; average $Ømega$arag from samples collected in the top 10 m was 2.5 compared to an average of 1.1 in samples below 100 m. The average depth of corrosive waters ($Ømega$arag \\textless 1) was interpolated for the shelf from the bottle data and was estimated to be an average of 100 m regionally, though there were instances when the saturation horizon rose to less than 20 m depth, primarily in the northern part of the coast during the spring. $Ømega$arag was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen indicating that patterns in $Ømega$arag were linked to biological processes. The seasonality and spatial patterns we observed on the continental shelf were comparable to those observed by the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) and West Coast Ocean Acidification (WCOA) programs in offshore southern California waters, suggesting that oceanic forcing is a strong driver defining broad patterns in aragonite saturation state on the shelf." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA) is likely to have an effect on the fertilizing potential of desert dust in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll oceanic regions, either by modifying iron (Fe) speciation and bioavailability or by altering phytoplankton Fe requirements and acquisition. To address this issue, short incubations (4 days) of northeast subarctic Pacific waters enriched with either FeSO4 or dust and set at pH 8.0 (in situ) and 7.8 were conducted in August 2010. We assessed the impact of a decrease in pH on dissolved Fe concentration, phytoplankton biomass, taxonomy and productivity, and the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its algal precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Chlorophyll a (chl a) remained unchanged in the controls and doubled in both the FeSO4-enriched and dust-enriched incubations, confirming the Fe-limited status of the plankton assemblage during the experiment. In the acidified treatments, a significant reduction (by 16–38 %) in the final concentration of chl a was measured compared to their nonacidified counterparts, and a 15 % reduction in particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration was measured in the dust-enriched acidified treatment compared to the dust-enriched nonacidified treatment. FeSO4 and dust additions had a fertilizing effect mainly on diatoms and cyanobacteria as estimated from algal pigment signatures. Lowering the pH affected mostly the haptophytes, but pelagophyte concentrations were also reduced in some acidified treatments. Acidification did not significantly alter DMSP and DMS concentrations. These results show that dust deposition events in a low-pH iron-limited northeast subarctic Pacific are likely to stimulate phytoplankton growth to a lesser extent than in today's ocean during the few days following fertilization and point to a low initial sensitivity of the DMSP and DMS dynamics to OA." ;

    :description "The impact of ocean acidification (OA) on coral calcification, a subject of intense current interest, is poorly understood in part because of the presence of symbionts in adult corals. Early life history stages of Acropora spp. provide an opportunity to study the effects of elevated CO2 on coral calcification without the complication of symbiont metabolism. Therefore, we used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study the effects of acute exposure to elevated CO2 on gene expression in primary polyps of Acropora millepora, using as reference a novel comprehensive transcriptome assembly developed for this study. Gene ontology analysis of this whole transcriptome data set indicated that CO2-driven acidification strongly suppressed metabolism but enhanced extracellular organic matrix synthesis, whereas targeted analyses revealed complex effects on genes implicated in calcification. Unexpectedly, expression of most ion transport proteins was unaffected, while many membrane-associated or secreted carbonic anhydrases were expressed at lower levels. The most dramatic effect of CO2-driven acidification, however, was on genes encoding candidate and known components of the skeletal organic matrix that controls CaCO3 deposition. The skeletal organic matrix effects included elevated expression of adult-type galaxins and some secreted acidic proteins, but down-regulation of other galaxins, secreted acidic proteins, SCRiPs and other coral-specific genes, suggesting specialized roles for the members of these protein families and complex impacts of OA on mineral deposition. This study is the first exhaustive exploration of the transcriptomic response of a scleractinian coral to acidification and provides an unbiased perspective on its effects during the early stages of calcification.

    :description "Concerns about the impacts of ocean acidification on marine life have mostly focused on how reduced carbonate saturation affects calcifying organisms. Here, we show that levels of CO2-induced acidification that may be attained by 2100 could also have significant effects on marine organisms by reducing their aerobic capacity. The effects of temperature and acidification on oxygen consumption were tested in 2 species of coral reef fishes, Ostorhinchus doederleini and O. cyanosoma, from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The capacity for aerobic activity (aerobic scope) declined at temperatures above the summer average (29°C) and in CO2-acidified water (pH 7.8 and ̃1000 ppm CO2) compared to control water (pH 8.15). Aerobic scope declined by 36 and 32% for O. doederleini and O. cyanosoma at temperatures between 29 to 32°C, whereas it declined by 33 and 47% for O. doederleini and O. cyanosoma in acidified water compared to control water. Thus, the declines in aerobic scope in acidified water were similar to those caused by a 3°C increase in water temperature. Minimum aerobic scope values of \\̃200 mg O2 kg–1 h–1 were attained for both species in acidified water at 32°C, compared with over 600 mg O2 kg–1 h–1 in control water at 29°C. Mortality rate increased sharply at 33°C, indicating that this temperature is close to the lethal thermal limit for both species. Acidification further increased the mortality rate of O. doederleini, but not of O. cyanosoma. These results show that coral reef fishes are sensitive to both higher temperatures and increased levels of dissolved CO2, and that the aerobic performance of some reef fishes could be significantly reduced if climate change continues unabated." ;

    :description "We tested the effect of near-future CO2 levels (≈490, 570, 700, and 960 $μ$atm CO2) on the olfactory responses and activity levels of juvenile coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus, a piscivorous reef fish that is also one of the most important fisheries species on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Juvenile coral trout reared for 4 weeks at 570 $μ$atm CO2 exhibited similar sensory responses and behaviors to juveniles reared at 490 $μ$atm CO2 (control). In contrast, juveniles reared at 700 and 960 $μ$atm CO2 exhibited dramatically altered sensory function and behaviors. At these higher CO2 concentrations, juveniles became attracted to the odor of potential predators, as has been observed in other reef fishes. They were more active, spent less time in shelter, ventured further from shelter, and were bolder than fish reared at 490 or 570 $μ$atm CO2. These results demonstrate that behavioral impairment of coral trout is unlikely if pCO2 remains below 600 $μ$atm; however, at higher levels, there are significant impacts on juvenile performance that are likely to affect survival and energy budgets, with consequences for predator–prey interactions and commercial fisheries.

    :description "The development of small portable USB‐spectrophotometer systems makes monitoring alkalinity and pH possible in the field and remote locations. Here, we present a method utilizing purified bromophenol blue (BPB) as an end‐point indicator for making simple one‐point alkalinity measurements with spectrophotometric detection. The approach utilizes purified BPB dye whose absorbance characteristics have been determined over a range of temperatures and salinities. The end‐point pH for titrated samples was determined using the BPB absorbance ratio (R(t) = 25 A590/A436) for the acid and base forms via the following equation: urn:x-wiley:15415856:media:lom310253:lom310253-math-0001, where, e1 = 0.00533, e2 = 2.232, e3 = 0.0319. A pKa of 3.513 was determined for the dissociation of the second proton from the BPB dye. The temperature (t) dependence of R can be expressed using the following relationship: urn:x-wiley:15415856:media:lom310253:lom310253-math-0002. The dependence of the pKa on salinity (S) was weak and can be expressed as urn:x-wiley 15415856:media:lom310253:lom310253-math-0003. Application of the method for determining the alkalinity of in‐house and certified standards typically produced an uncertainty of ± 1.5 $μ$mol kg−1 for purified BPB dye. When the impure BPB dye was used as an end‐point indicator the uncertainty for alkalinity measured was slightly higher at approximately ± 3–4 $μ$mol kg−1. Hence, if high‐precision alkalinity measurements are not required (≥ 4 $μ$mol kg−1) then utilization of the unpurified BPB maybe suitable. We also compared the use of BPB to two other dyes: bromocresol purple (BCP) and bromocresol green (BCG). The utilization of all three dyes for end‐point determination produced comparable results with an overall precision of ± 4 $μ$mol kg−1. The one‐point titration method using BPB was utilized at a remote field location, One Tree Island, Australia and was found to be suitable for producing accurate and precise alkalinity data in a timely manner; ∼ 10–15 samples can be determined per hour. When combined with seawater pH measurements, the one‐point titration method allows the full marine carbonate system to be fully constrained without the need for high‐tech spectrophotometric equipment and comprehensive laboratory facilities." ;

\r
There have been many changes in the country’s education system and policies since independence 40 years ago. This plan is designed to build on past successes and experience and begin a system providing 13 years Universal Education. High-quality, relevant education and training for all.\r
\r
This plan is different to previous plans in a number of ways. Firstly it outlines all interventions needed that together will achieve Universal Education in PNG. This National Education Plan intends to have PNG leading the way by taking the bold step towards13 years of Universal Education for every student in the country. Universal Education can be achieved in our country with a coordinated approach supported by strong political drive, quality leadership and a relentlessness to achieve its intent.\r
\r
Contained in this plan is the outline of the radical and comprehensive overhaul of many aspects of the education system proposed to give all children the opportunity to enter school at the age of six and receive a relevant education for 13 years, until they reach Grade 12 or the equivalent (18 years of age).\r
\r
The NEP 2015-19 is based on a logic framework, so that the plan itself can be monitored and progressed measured. Every province will play a critical role in implementing the plan and using the same framework, they can compare their progress at provincial and national level. This approach means DoE is transparent in its approach and accountable to achieve its targets. """ ;

The survey was carried out in just one day in September 2005, resulting in the acquisition of over 81 km of multibeam echosounder (MBES) data. Bathymetric map of Nauru showing the island and approximate position of the exclusive economic zone. The resultant dataset was used to create bathymetry charts which are available for download from its appropriate link under Distribution Info.
This work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.To give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features, and serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.Coastline - Nauru rises from a sandy beach with a 19-km coastline encircling the island. There have been rapid changes in the coastal geography associated with increasing development. Coastal erosion is an increasing problem in Nauru due to the interruption of long-shore currents by development of boat channels, harbour facilities and the extension of the airport runway.""" ;

    :description "Habitat warming and acidification experienced by intertidal invertebrates are potentially detrimental to sensitive early post-larvae of benthic marine invertebrates. To determine the potential impact of acidification and warming on a conspicuous component of the temperate intertidal fauna of the southern hemisphere, the response of newly metamorphosed juvenile (ca. 450 $μ$m diameter) sea stars (Parvulastra exigua) to increased acidification and temperature was investigated with respect to conditions recorded in the habitat (− 0.4–0.6 pH units, + 2-4 °C), in all combinations of stressors. In situ monitoring was used to generate data on environmental conditions. The pHNIST of the tide pools varied from 7.54 (pCO2 2045 $μ$atm) at predawn to 8.91 (pCO2 28 $μ$atm) in the afternoon and temperature varied from 10 °C at night to 24 °C during the day, conditions that fluctuated from baseline sea surface conditions of pH 8.2 and 16 °C. P. exigua was used as a model tolerant intertidal species to generate insights into stress tolerance of the early benthic life stage. After a 4-week incubation in experimental conditions, negative effects on juvenile development and growth were only observed at pHNIST 7.2 (− 1.0 units/pCO2 4430–4601$μ$atm; $Ømega$cal 0.6, $Ømega$ar 0.4). Our results indicate that juvenile P. exigua is physiologically acclimatised to tolerate extreme conditions indicating that it may be robust to near future (ca. 2100) change in ocean conditions. Although it is difficult to know how tide pools will change in the future, pulses of the deleterious level of acidification (pHNIST 7.2) may occur in the intertidal in future night time low tides." ;

    :description "1.Seaweeds are able to modify the chemical environment at their surface, in a micro‐zone called the diffusive boundary layer (DBL), via their metabolic processes controlled by light intensity. Depending on the thickness of the DBL, sessile invertebrates such as calcifying bryozoans or tube‐forming polychaetes living on the surface of the blades can be affected by the chemical variations occurring in this microlayer. Especially in the context of ocean acidification (OA), these microhabitats might be considered as a refuge from lower pH, because during the day photosynthesis temporarily raises the pH to values higher than in the mainstream seawater.  2.We assessed the thickness and the characteristics of the DBL at two pH levels (today's average surface ocean pH 8.1 and a reduced pH predicted for the end of the century, pH 7.7) and seawater flows (slow, 0.5 and fast, \\textgreater8 cm/s) on Ecklonia radiata (kelp) blades. Oxygen and pH profiles from the blade surface to the mainstream seawater were measured with O2 and pH microsensors for both bare blades and blades colonized by the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea.  3.The DBL was thicker in slow flow compared with fast flow and the presence of bryozoans increased the DBL thickness and shaped the DBL gradient in dark conditions. Net production was increased in the low pH condition, increasing the amount of oxygen in the DBL in both bare and epiphytized blades. This increase drove the daily pH fluctuations at the blade surface, shifting them towards higher values compared with today's pH. The presence of bryozoans led to lower oxygen concentrations in the DBL and more complex pH fluctuations at the blade surface, particularly at pH 7.7. 4.Overall, this study, based on microprofiles, shows that, in slow flow, DBL microenvironments at the surface of the kelps may constitute a refuge from OA with pH values higher than those of the mainstream seawater. For calcifying organisms, it could also represent training ground for harsh conditions, with broad daily pH and oxygen fluctuations. These chemical microenvironments, biologically shaped by the macrophytes, are of great interest for the resilience of coastal ecosystems in the context of global change. " ;

    :description "Two of the major threats to coral reefs are increasing sea surface temperature and ocean acidification, both of which result from rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Recent evidence suggests that both increased water temperature and elevated levels of dissolved CO2 can change the behaviors of fishes in ways that reduce individual fitness, however the interacting effects of these variables are unknown. We used a fully factorial experiment to test the independent and interactive effects of temperature (3 levels: 28.5, 30, and 31.5 °C) and pCO2 (3 levels: averaging 420, 530, and 960 $μ$atm) on food consumption and activity level of juvenile anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus (Bleeker 1852). Experimental levels were consistent with current-day ocean conditions and predictions for mid-century and late-century based on atmospheric CO2 projections. Sibling fish were reared for 21 days from the end of their larval phase in each of the nine treatments, at which time behavioral observations were conducted. Food consumption and foraging activity decreased at the highest temperature. In isolation, CO2 level did not significantly affect behavior; however, there was an interaction with temperature. While rearing at high temperature (31.5 °C) and control (420 $μ$atm) or moderate (530 $μ$atm) CO2 resulted in a reduction of food consumption and foraging activity, rearing at high temperature and high CO2 (960 $μ$atm) resulted in an elevation in these behaviors. Maintaining food consumption and foraging activity in high temperature and CO2 conditions may reduce energy efficiency if the thermal optimum for food assimilation and growth has been exceeded. Maintaining foraging effort might increase predation vulnerability. These results suggest that changes in foraging behaviors caused by the interactive effects of increased SST and CO2 could have significant effects on the growth and survival of juvenile reef fishes by late century.

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA) and the biological consequences of altered seawater chemistry have emerged as a significant environmental threat to healthy marine ecosystems. Because a more acidic ocean interferes with fixation of calcium carbonate to form shells or calcified skeletons, future ocean chemistry may significantly alter the physiology of calcifying marine organisms. These alterations may manifest themselves directly in the calcification process, or have synergistic effects with other environmental factors such as elevated temperatures. New tools permit us to explore subtle changes in gene expression patterns in response to environmental conditions. We raised sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) under conditions simulating future atmospheric CO2 levels of 540 and 970 ppm. When larvae raised under elevated CO2 conditions were subjected to 1-h acute temperature stress, their ability to mount a physiological response (as measured by expression of the molecular chaperone hsp70) was reduced relative to those raised under ambient CO2 conditions. These results represent the first use of gene expression assays to study the effects of OA on sea urchin development. They highlight the importance of looking at multiple environmental factors simultaneously as this approach may reveal previously unsuspected biological impacts of atmospheric changes." ;

    :description "Biomaterials connect organisms to their environments. Their function depends on biological, chemical and environmental factors, both at the time of creation and throughout the life of the material. Shifts in the chemistry of the oceans driven by anthropogenic CO2 (termed ocean acidification) have profound implications for the function of critical materials formed under these altered conditions. Most ocean acidification studies have focused on one biomaterial (secreted calcium carbonate), frequently using a single assay (net rate of calcification) to quantify whether reductions in environmental pH alter how organisms create biomaterials1. Here, we examine biological structures critical for the success of ecologically and economically important bivalve molluscs. One non-calcified material, the proteinaceous byssal threads that anchor mytilid mussels to hard substrates, exhibited reduced mechanical performance when secreted under elevated pCO2 conditions, whereas shell and tissue growth were unaffected. Threads made under high pCO2 (\\textgreater1,200 \\$μ\\$atm) were weaker and less extensible owing to compromised attachment to the substratum. According to a mathematical model, this reduced byssal fibre performance, decreasing individual tenacity by 40%. In the face of ocean acidification, weakened attachment presents a potential challenge for suspension-culture mussel farms and for intertidal communities anchored by mussel beds. " ;

    :description "Corals build their skeletons using extracellular calcifying fluid located in the tissue-skeleton interface. However, the mechanism by which corals control the transport of calcium and other ions from seawater and the mechanism of constant alkalization of calcifying fluid are largely unknown. To address these questions, we performed direct pH imaging at calcification sites (subcalicoblastic medium, SCM) to visualize active pH upregulation in live aposymbiotic primary coral polyps treated with HCl-acidified seawater. Active alkalization was observed in all individuals using vital staining method while the movement of HPTS and Alexa Fluor to SCM suggests that certain ions such as H(+) could diffuse via a paracellular pathway to SCM. Among them, we discovered acid-induced oscillations in the pH of SCM (pHSCM), observed in 24% of polyps examined. In addition, we discovered acid-induced pH up-regulation waves in 21% of polyps examined, which propagated among SCMs after exposure to acidified seawater. Our results showed that corals can regulate pHSCM more dynamically than was previously believed. These observations will have important implications for determining how corals regulate pHSCM during calcification. We propose that corals can sense ambient seawater pH via their innate pH-sensitive systems and regulate pHSCM using several unknown pH-regulating ion transporters that coordinate with multicellular signaling occurring in coral tissue." ;

    :description "The marine life of Canada's Pacific marine ecosystems, adjacent to the province of British Columbia, may be relatively responsive to rapid oceanographic and environmental change associated with global climate change due to uniquely evolved plasticities and resiliencies as well as particular sensitivities and vulnerabilities, given this dynamic and highly textured natural setting. These marine ecosystems feature complex interfaces of coastal geomorphology, climate, and oceanography, including a dynamic oceanographic and ecological transition zone formed by the divergence of the North Pacific Current into the Alaskan coastal current and the California Current, and by currents transporting warm tropical waters from the south. Despite long-term warming in the region, sea surface temperatures in Canada's Pacific have been anomalously cool since 2007 with La Niña-type conditions prevailing as we enter a cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, possibly masking future warming. When warmer El Niño conditions prevail, many southern species invade, strongly impacting local species and reorganizing biological communities. Acidification and deoxygenation are anomalously high in the region due to the weakening ventilation of subsurface waters resulting from increased stratification. A broad spectrum of biological responses to these changes are expected. Non-climate anthropogenic stressors affect the capacity of biota to adapt to climate changes. It will be challenging to forecast the responses of particular species, and to map climate vulnerabilities accurately enough to help prioritize and guide adaptation planning. It will be more challenging to develop forecasts that account for indirect effects within biological communities and the intricate and apparently non-deterministic behaviours of highly complex and variable marine ecosystems, such as those of Canada's Pacific. We recommend and outline national and regional climate assessments in Canada and adaptation planning and implementation including integrated coastal management and marine spatial planning and management.

It proposes a set of indicators that are contextually relevant and meaningful for the region, acknowledging the unique challenges and opportunities that Pacific Island countries experience in data collection, national institutions and resources.
The guide is meant to assist coordinating bodies within Pacific Island governments responsible for preparing initial and periodic reports on the country’s progress on implementation of ratified treaties, as well as those overseeing the implementation of national human rights action plans. The guide will also help national statistics offices to better understand how the statistical data they collect, analyse and provide feeds into human rights reporting.""" ;

This narrative reaffirms our shared ownership of the Pacific Ocean and the connection of all Pacific peoples with their natural resources, environment, and livelihoods, and aims to harness their shared ocean identity, geography and resources to drive positive socio-cultural, political and economic development. The adoption of the Pacific Regional Education Framework (PacREF) 2018 – 2030 by Forum Education Ministers in 2018, outlined a transformative and sustainable regional education agenda aligned with global agendas such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) particularly SDG4, the education goal and Education 2030: Incheon Declaration on Education for All Framework for Action. The PacREF’s four key policy areas of Quality and Relevance, Learning Pathways, Students Outcomes and Wellbeing and Teacher Professionalism will support the Forum Leaders’ Pacific Vision over the next twelve years.

This report describes the high-resolution bathymetric mapping survey carried out over a period
of three weeks from 28 May to 15 June 2006, resulting in the acquisition of over 733 line-km of
MBES data. The survey achieved variable coverage of 50–100% (less for shallow water areas)
of the seafloor from approximately 50 m in the inshore area to an average offshore distance of 4
km, reaching maximum water depths of some 2000 m.
The dashed line in Bathymetric map of Papua New Guinea illustrates approximate boundary of PNG Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The wave and current regime inside Madang lagoon and Vanimo harbour was also investigated. 
This work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States ProjectThe objective of the survey contained in the report was to investigate the seabed and provide information about water depths around the islands using a Multibeam echosounder (MBES).Coastline: The coastline is dominated mostly by coral reefs, with mountain ranges rising directly from the sea or from narrow coastal plains.""" ;

    :description """High-resolution swath mapping, using multibeam echo sounder was used to delineate the seabed morphology around Madang ,Papua New guinea at the maximum depth coverage in the lagoon of 50 m at the entrance around the southern end,near the main harbour. 
The resultant data was used to produce bathymetry charts and the Madang Bathymetry chart is available for download from its appropriate link under Distribution Info. This work was initiated by the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the European Union (EU) Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.The objective of the survey was to investigate the seabed and provide information about water depths in the coastal areas using a Multibeam echosounder (MBES). Bathymetry maps/ charts should provide information about water depths around the islands. These new bathymetric maps should also give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features. They can serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.Madang, located 5 degrees 10' S and 145 degrees 20' E, on the northern coast of the mainland of Papua New Guinea. SUMMARY OF SEABED AROUND MADANG:The two survey lines in the lagoon did not capture many features of the seafloor. The maximum depth of coverage in the lagoon was 50 m at the entrance around the southern end,near the main harbour. The average water depth in the lagoon was around 15 m. The seafloor appeared to be rather featureless, with a few coral heads. The seafloor around Madang drops off sharply at an angle of about 45 - 50o () to about 200 m water depths. A very prominent south west trending fault scarp is seen about 5 km north of theMadang harbour entrance channel. The seafloor is quite featureless to the south of this fault scarp with an exception of a seamount (planet rock) rising from a depth of around 300 m to about 5 m below sea level. To the north of the fault scarp, numerous small canyons are seen to be originating from the 600 m contour and leveling off at around 1 300 m water depths. Only one canyon is seen originating at the entrance of the northern end of the lagoon and levels off at around 1200 m water depth.""" ;

This work was initiated by the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the European Union (EU) Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.The objective of the survey was to investigate the seabed and provide information about water depths in the coastal areas using a Multibeam echosounder (MBES).

Bathymetry maps/ charts should provide information about water depths around the islands. These new bathymetric maps should also give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features. They can serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.SUMMARY OF SEABED AROUND SISSANOSissano is located approximately 142.07 degrees East and 2.016 degrees South, of the Northern end of Papua New Guinea.The sea floor offshore Sissano is quite featureless except for the two canyons. For around 10 km offshore the seafloor stays almost flat with an average slope angle of around 3o (Figure13). The water depth within this area is around 100 m. A canyon originates at approximately 3km to the north of Yalingi River, in water depths of around 200 m. This canyon runs northeast for approximately 3 km and then trends in the north northeast direction. Numerous slump features are visible on either side of the canyon, with few small seamounts on the edge of the canyon which have partly succumbed to the slumping. A second much smaller canyon was mapped at about 6 km to the north of Raihu River. This canyon originates in about 100 m water depth, runs approximately about 2 km northeast, then trends north and levels off in about 700 m water depth. Few smaller canyons are seen to thewest of this canyon.""" ;

A canyon originates at approximately 3km to the north of Yalingi River, in water depths of around 200 m. This canyon runs northeast for approximately 3 km and then trends in the north northeast direction. Numerous slump features are visible on either side of the canyon, with few small seamounts on the edge of the canyon which have partly succumbed to the slumping. A second much smaller canyon was mapped at about 6 km to the north of Raihu River. This canyon originates in about 100 m water depth, runs approximately about 2 km northeast, then trends north and levels off in about 700 m water depth. Few smaller canyons are seen to thewest of this canyon.""" ;

A historical simulation for the past three decades (1980 to 2010) was performed using the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (version 2), a coupled climate model with atmospheric, terrestrial and ocean cycles. As the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased, acidification progressed in the surface waters of the marginal sea. The acidification was similar in magnitude to observations and models of acidification in the global ocean. However, in the global ocean, the acidification appears to be due to increased in-situ oceanic CO2 uptake, whereas local processes had stronger effects in the East Sea. pH was lowered by surface warming and by the influx of water with higher dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the northwestern Pacific. Due to the enhanced advection of DIC, the partial pressure of CO2 increased faster than in the overlying air; consequently, the in-situ oceanic uptake of CO2 decreased." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification (OA) is predicted to have widespread implications for marine organisms, yet the capacity for species to acclimate or adapt over this century remains unknown. Recent transgenerational studies have shown that for some marine species, exposure of adults to OA can facilitate positive carryover effects to their larval and juvenile offspring that help them to survive in acidifying oceanic conditions. But whether these positive carryover effects can persist into adulthood or the next generation is unknown. Here we tested whether positive carryover effects found in larvae of the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata following transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2, could persist into adulthood and whether subsequent transgenerational exposure of adults to elevated CO2 would facilitate similar adaptive responses in the next generation of larvae and juveniles. Following our previous transgenerational exposure of parental adults and first generation (F1) larvae to ambient (385 $μ$atm) and elevated (856 $μ$atm) CO2, newly settled F1 juveniles were transferred to the field at ambient CO2 for 14 months, until they reached reproductive maturity. At this time, the F1 adults were returned to the laboratory and the previous transgenerational CO2 exposure was repeated to produce F2 offspring. We found that the capacity of adults to regulate extracellular pH at elevated CO2 was improved if they had a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2. In addition, subsequent transgenerational exposure of these adults led to an increase in the resilience of their larval and juvenile offspring. Offspring with a history of transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 had a lower percentage abnormality, faster development rate, faster shell growth and increased heart rate at elevated CO2 compared with F2 offspring with no prior history of exposure to elevated CO2. Our results suggest that positive carryover effects originating during parental and larval exposure will be important in mediating some of the impacts of OA for later life-history stages and generations." ;

While higher temperature and lower pH can have negative effects on fertilisation and development of marine invertebrates, warming may partially ameliorate the negative effect of lower pH. This study determined the effect of warming (3 °C) and decreased pH (0.3, 0.5, 1.1 units below ambient) on fertilisation and development in two populations of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, one at its northern range limit (Coffs Harbour, New South Wales NSW, 30°27′S, 153°14′E) and the other one in New Zealand where the species may be a recent arrival (Mokohinau Islands, 35°56′S, 175°9′E). Both populations were sampled in August 2011. The two populations exhibited a differential response to temperature, while pH affected them similarly. Fertilisation was robust to pH levels forecast for 2100, and it was only slightly reduced at pH values forecast for 2300 (i.e. ≈5 and ≈8 % for the northern NSW and the New Zealand populations, respectively). Decreased pH (pH = 7.6) reduced the percentage of succeeding developmental stages. Progression through cleavage and hatching stages was faster at +3 °C in the New Zealand population but not in northern NSW urchins, while for the NSW population, there was a positive interaction between temperature and pH at hatching. Gastrulation was negatively affected by an extreme pH 7.0 treatment (60–80 % reduction) and least affected by increased temperature. The percentage of abnormal embryos at gastrulation increased significantly at +3 °C treatment in the northern NSW population. Predicted future increases in temperature may facilitate further expansion of the geographical range of C. rodgersii in New Zealand, with a minimal effect of concurrent reduced pH." ;

    :description "Reefs and People at Risk  Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere put shallow, warm-water coral reef ecosystems, and the people who depend upon them at risk from two key global environmental stresses: 1) elevated sea surface temperature (that can cause coral bleaching and related mortality), and 2) ocean acidification. These global stressors: cannot be avoided by local management, compound local stressors, and hasten the loss of ecosystem services. Impacts to people will be most grave where a) human dependence on coral reef ecosystems is high, b) sea surface temperature reaches critical levels soonest, and c) ocean acidification levels are most severe. Where these elements align, swift action will be needed to protect people's lives and livelihoods, but such action must be informed by data and science.  An Indicator Approach  Designing policies to offset potential harm to coral reef ecosystems and people requires a better understanding of where CO2-related global environmental stresses could cause the most severe impacts. Mapping indicators has been proposed as a way of combining natural and social science data to identify policy actions even when the needed science is relatively nascent. To identify where people are at risk and where more science is needed, we map indicators of biological, physical and social science factors to understand how human dependence on coral reef ecosystems will be affected by globally-driven threats to corals expected in a high-CO2 world. Western Mexico, Micronesia, Indonesia and parts of Australia have high human dependence and will likely face severe combined threats. As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly at risk. Many of the countries most dependent upon coral reef ecosystems are places for which we have the least robust data on ocean acidification. These areas require new data and interdisciplinary scientific research to help coral reef-dependent human communities better prepare for a high CO2 world." ;

An increase in human activities in river basins may alter the natural riverine nutrients and carbon export to coastal ecosystems. Along a wide latitudinal range (32°55′S–40°10′S), this study explores the role of climate and land use in determining the nutrient and carbon concentrations in the river mouth and fluxes to adjacent coastal areas. Between winter 2011 and fall 2012, we collected monthly samples in five river mouths in central southern Chile and at rocky shore sites affected by river plumes. Basins were characterized by different land uses and meteorological conditions along this latitudinal range. Water samples were collected for pH measurements, nutrients, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and isotopic signatures ($δ$13C). Our results show a north-south gradient in concentrations of nutrients and carbon. The highest concentrations were observed in the Maipo basin, which presents the highest percentage of urban-industrial activities. Nutrients and carbon contributions, in most cases, were lowest in the southern Valdivia basin, which has the least human intervention and a greater percentage of vegetation. The Biobío River had the highest nutrient and carbon fluxes, in most cases, due to its high river discharge. Our results show the influence of river plume effects on carbon and nitrogen concentrations in river-influenced rocky shore sites. Moreover, our study suggests that land use might influence some parameters of carbonate system in rivers and river-influenced rocky shore environments. River-influenced rocky shore environments may exhibit suppression in aragonite saturation state with implications for calcifiers inhabiting these marine environments." ;

This article presents medium-resolution bathymetry of the main peak along with benthic imagery, biological observations of multiple trophic levels living inside the active crater, petrological and geochemical analysis of samples from the crater rim, measurements of water temperature and gas flux over the summit, and descriptions of the hydrothermal plume structure. A second peak was identified to the southwest of the main summit and displayed evidence of diffuse-flow venting. Microbial samples collected from the summit indicate chemosynthetic populations dominated by sulfur-reducing $ε$-proteobacteria. Populations of gelatinous animals, small fish, and sharks were observed inside the active crater, raising new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals can exist.

Modification of predator behaviour via ocean warming has been assessed by laboratory experimentation and metabolic theory. However, the influence of ocean acidification with ocean warming remains largely unexplored for mesopredators, including experimental assessments that incorporate key components of the assemblages in which animals naturally live. We employ a combination of long-term laboratory and mesocosm experiments containing natural prey and habitat to assess how warming and acidification affect the development, growth, and hunting behaviour in sharks. Although embryonic development was faster due to temperature, elevated temperature and CO2 had detrimental effects on sharks by not only increasing energetic demands, but also by decreasing metabolic efficiency and reducing their ability to locate food through olfaction. The combination of these effects led to considerable reductions in growth rates of sharks held in natural mesocosms with elevated CO2, either alone or in combination with higher temperature. Our results suggest a more complex reality for predators, where ocean acidification reduces their ability to effectively hunt and exert strong top-down control over food webs." ;

    :description """Among the consequences of conflict over gender roles or norms, the most disempowering one is violence against women. As part of the World Bank’s qualitative study informing the World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development, local researchers in Fiji and Papua New Guinea organised focus groups to elicit information about the impact of gender norms on women and men and to learn about the changes in women’s and men’s lives as these gender norms changed or persisted. 

This short paper presents men’s and women’s accounts of domestic violence when we asked focus groups to reflect on what typically happens in their communities when a wife is not a good wife or a husband is not a good husband. The focus groups’ narratives consistently reported that men who are unable to fulfil their provider role often act out their frustrations with violence, and that it remains acceptable in many communities to sanction women harshly for minor infractions that are perceived as challenging male authority or norms of feminine conduct. 

Existing studies suggest that men’s lives in the Pacific are enmeshed in processes of transformation. In particular, masculine ideals of men are being actively challenged where changing socio-economic conditions make it difficult to realise dominant models of masculinity. This greatly complicates women’s agency and their pursuit of goals requires either resistance to, or relaxation of, the gender norms that govern their roles and responsibilities. There is limited research being done exploring why gender norms around traditional roles of men and women often persist even when circumstances change.""" ;

The conference made a number of recommendations regarding the priority areas of violence against women, health and access to services, as well as on gender disaggregation in the context of the ‘data revolution’. Discussions highlighted actions taken by the Pacific Island countries and territories to improve prevention and response to violence against women.  

The Conference Outcome Statements addresses: 

- 2013 Pacific Regional Millennium Development Goals Tracking Report. 

- Mechanisms to promote the empowerment of women. 

- Women’s legal and human rights. 

- Women’s access to services - education and health. 

- Economic empowerment of women. 

- Emerging areas of work. 

- Upcoming regional and international processes. 

- Additional items raised by Pacific Island countries and territories. 

The Pacific Young Women’s Leadership Alliance identified five strategic recommendations on: 

- Eliminating sexual and gender-based violence. 

- Ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights. 

- Eliminating all forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities. 

- Promoting full and decent employment and economic empowerment for young women. 

- Ensuring full participation of young women at all levels of decision making.

- Women with disabilities make significant contributions to their communities. However, while they have similar talents, skills and experience as other women, they may be more often underrecognised and have fewer opportunities. 

- Each country has a committed and active disabled persons organisation and a family health association that are in a good position to increase their focus on disability and sexuality. 

- The report lists programs and activities that have dealt with the intersection of disabilities and sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR). 

- The three countries have policies relating to people with disabilities, health and ending violence against women to which SRHR issues could be incorporated into implementation. 

- The Incheon Declaration to “Make the Right Real for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific 2013 to 2022” specifically discusses SRH issues. 

- Family is central to the lives of women with a disabilities, providing the vast majority of support and assistance. Where families were less supportive or caring, women experienced significant hardship. Families require training, support and assistance. 

- Generally, community attitudes conform with stereotypical and prejudiced perspectives on people with disabilities. Women with disabilities tend to feel that their closest community accepted them but often felt that the wider community ridiculed them, leading to feelings of shame and fear. 

- Women with disabilities experience a range of intimate relationships throughout their lives. Many are married and had children. Most enjoy consensual sexual relations. 

- Women with disabilities do not have a good understanding of their full SRHR and need more education and easy access to services. 

- Women with disabilities tended to interact with health services most regularly when they are pregnant. There is a need for more engagement with health services. 

- Health professionals and other social service staff require capacity building to enhance their skills and confidence in working with women with disabilities. 

- Appropriate and accessible information, education and communication resources are required to meet the information needs of women with vision, hearing and/or intellectual impairments. 

- Some women with disabilities experience violence. There are indications that women with disabilities may experience sexual violence perpetrated by acquaintances or strangers at a higher rate than other women. 

- Several women interviewed became pregnant as a result of rape. 

- Women with disabilities living in institutions have particular needs that do not appear to be adequately addressed. These women are at risk of abuse. 

- Women with a mental illness or intellectual disability sometimes experience particularly severe discriminations, including multiple rapes, involuntary sterilisation and the imposition of contraceptive use despite their inability to give informed consent.""" ;

It also enables them to identify policy and research gaps and develop and implement effective evidence-based sexual and reproductive health and rights policies – particularly for women.

There are three PICTS in the ‘Very High’ risk category: Papua New Guinea, Tokelau and Kiribati.  The report recommends ignoring Tokelau’s result due to lack of data.

    :description """During the webinar, the following points about women’s economic empowerment raised the most questions and discussion: 

- Women’s economic status is disproportionately affected by the impacts of COVID-19: 

- Women are more likely than men to work in low-paying, informal and precarious work, without safety nets, job security, paid leave or insurance for economic shocks. 

- Small island countries (or ‘big ocean countries’) have been particularly affected by challenges with food security during COVID-19 due to their reliance on food imports and remittances. Changes to global transport and food supply chains and drops in the overseas employment income of relatives, have posed significant challenges for many Pacific families, with major implications for women who are usually responsible for sourcing and preparing meals for their families and communities. Women also make up the majority of market vendors, many of whom have lost income due to the closure of markets, increased competition in food sales and increased cost of many foods. 

- Pacific women are taking on the increased childcare and domestic labour responsibilities, known as the burden of unpaid work. This is arising from the closure of many schools and workplaces, and the movement of people back to rural areas, adding to their existing unpaid work load. Increased care work is also reducing the time women have available for money making activities. 

- There are actions Pacific governments can take to ensure responses to the economic impacts of COVID-19 respond to, and support women who are most affected. Important measures include ensuring basic incomes, insurance scheme for the unemployed and those in the informal economy, financial and in-kind relief to rural women bearing the burden of increased domestic labour and cash transfers for immediate needs, focusing on women. These actions can support women as they deal with the dual crisis of COVID-19 and the aftermath of Cyclone Harold in Fiji and Cyclone Tino in Tuvalu.

All but two PICs have ratified CEDAW. However, Pacific governments have experienced difficulties with timely CEDAW and general human rights reporting and effective implementation. A numbers of barriers have been identified which contribute to this including; the size of Pacific state structures, the lack of institutionalised mechanisms to report and implement human rights obligations and the inability to harmonise reporting obligations at the national level.3 Even countries are successful in enacting legislative change guided by CEDAW to achieve gender equality, the majority of Pacific Islanders live in rural areas or on outer islands, and that this rural population’s access to justice is limited to lower formal and informal courts." ;

    :description """This short paper draws on research undertaken in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in 2015. It specifically explored the relationship
between women’s economic empowerment and violence
against women through in-depth qualitative interviews.
Interviewees included business women in the urban context
of Arawa (Kieta District) and rural women involved in informal
marketing and alluvial mining (Panguna District) and in
informal marketing and cocoa farming (Tinputz District).

Preliminary analysis reveals a strong connection between
men’s excessive alcohol consumption and violence against
their intimate partners. The stories of violence confirm that when women bring economic resources into the household, they do not inevitably become more empowered or suffer less violence. 

A key lesson to be drawn from the Bougainville case study is that women’s economic empowerment programs need a wider focus beyond giving women access to economic opportunities. If women are to be truly empowered, work on gender is required, in particular the role of gender norms and practices in the context of marital relationships, and this must include an effort to address the excessive consumption of alcohol by male partners.""" ;

    :description """In the Pacific region, there has been some significant progress towards achieving the SRHR goals embedded in international commitments. The number of Pacific Island countries with national population policies is steadily increasing and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into primary health programs has also improved. Reducing child mortality is an area where the Pacific region is doing particularly well, with 10 of the 14 Forum island countries on track to achieving this goal. The small island states of Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu have also made notable progress in reducing maternal mortality, reporting close to 100 per cent skilled birth attendance. These gains would not have been possible without a consistent and unified effort from SRHR advocates across government and civil society. 

Despite this progress, immense challenges remain and, overall, in many Pacific Island countries and territories, poverty, vulnerability and exclusion are on the rise. Specific SRHR issues in the Pacific region include endemic levels of gender-based violence; low contraceptive prevalence rates (below 50 per cent across the Pacific); stigmatisation, discrimination and a lack of confidentiality in many health services; hyperendemic levels of sexually transmitted infections (on average one quarter of sexually active young people in the Pacific have a sexually transmitted infection); and high rates of teenage pregnancy. 

This manual contains three modules: 
Module 1: Awareness – This contains some of the key concepts in SRHR, the legal and policy frameworks that guide SRHR at an international, regional and national level and the specific issues in the context of the Pacific region. 
Module 2: Analysis – This outlines the needs and challenges of a number of vulnerable and marginalised individuals and groups who face the greatest barriers to claiming their sexual and reproductive health and rights. 
Module 3: Action – This provides information on how to take action to advance SRHR across five key areas. This section includes practical strategies and best practice case studies being carried out in the Pacific region.""" ;

Specifically, Balance of Power aims to contribute to a ‘better balance’ in women’s and men’s leadership roles and opportunities. Building on lessons learned on what works and what doesn’t in the Pacific context, the innovation is in three key parts: 

- Balance of Power takes a very different approach by interrogating, in local contexts, the deeply entrenched social norms that define and legitimise leadership – across multiple spaces and institutions. 

- Balance of Power is led and managed by highly skilled Pacific Islanders, acknowledging that social norm change is best articulated and driven by local actors.

- Balance of Power takes a ‘thinking and working politically’ approach, which seeks to convene, and understand the interests of, diverse stakeholders, with a focus on influencing and incentivising power-holders and norm-changers. 

The first phase of Balance of Power will initially focus on Vanuatu and Tonga. Small country offices have been established in Port Vila and Nuku’alofa, supported by the regional head office in Suva. The time-frame for this first phase is 2019 to 2024. 

The high-level outcomes of Balance of Power are: 

- Women’s right to participate in the public sphere, including in humanitarian response decision-making, is increasingly accepted and valued by women and men in the community. 

- There is a shifting balance of power towards women and men sharing decision-making at all levels. 

- Traditional, church, and democratic governance institutions demonstrate action consistent with their commitments on women in leadership, and role-model integration of women’s voice and agency.""" ;

    :description """In the lead-up to the Beijing Conference, the Pacific Islands region adopted the Pacific Platform for Action (PPA). Its purpose was to identify regional issues and priorities within those Critical Areas and to put them into a local context. The framework was subsequently reviewed and a Revised Pacific Platform for Action on Advancement of Women and Gender Equality (RPPA) was endorsed in 2004. 

In preparation for the global 15-year review of implementation of the BPA (Beijing+15), UN regional commissions collaborated with the UN Division for the Advancement of Women to facilitate regional dialogue and preparations. In the case of Asia and the Pacific, this activity was coordinated by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in Bangkok, Thailand. Several Pacific governments participated in ESCAP’s Asia–Pacific High-level Intergovernmental Meeting in Bangkok in November 2009 to discuss regional progress in implementing the BPA, and again at the 54th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York in March 2010 when the world came together to discuss global progress. 

This report is guided primarily by the BPA and its 15-year review instrument, but also by the RPPA and other relevant regional and international gender equality frameworks. It also aims to increase understanding at regional and national levels of what is needed to move gender equality forward through key areas for action. 

The report will be used as a baseline document for discussion at the 11th Triennial Conference of Pacific Women, to be convened by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in August 2010, and will provide governments, civil society actors, development partners and Pacific Island women and men more generally with a resource for understanding where we are on the road to gender equality, and the journey we have yet to travel.""" ;

In the aftermath of the alcohol-related clash between the security forces in Port Moresby in November 2014, the National Capital District Commission liquor licensing board announced a ban on alcohol. The managing director of SP brewery responded by arguing that alcohol contributes significant tax revenue, and that liquor bans are not successful and would ‘force the issue underground and [have] devastating outcomes on the longer term’. 

This short paper looks at how studies of material culture, commodities or substances can offer guidance to policymakers who are addressing the social, political and economic implications of alcohol.

 The author argues that an ethnographic analysis of alcohol that draws on approaches to studying substances and products could yield much-needed insights into the social processes that influence contemporary intersections between masculinity, violence and alcohol.

The research also highlights pathways to leadership for young women including opportunities within community organisations, and the motivations that encourage them to join groups such as Bougainville Women’s Federation (BWF). 

The findings frame recommendations that focus on how BWF can engage and empower young women and create safe spaces for them to contribute to the organisation’s work and future.

- There is a knowledge gap amongst school-aged girls related to menstruation and reproductive health more generally. This lack of knowledge also extends to the school-aged boys and mothers. 

- Some teachers interviewed indicated that they were unaware that Menstrual Hygiene Management is part of the curriculum. 

- Traditional beliefs and practices related to menstruation are strong in Kiribati communities, in both the urban and rural settings. These traditional beliefs affect girls’ lives in a number of intersecting ways. 

- Cultural beliefs make speaking about menstruation amongst men and boys taboo. 

- Girls, teachers and their mothers commonly stated that absenteeism and decreased participation in class was common due to poor WASH facilities in schools, girls’ unpreparedness for their period due to inability to track their period, feeling uncomfortable because of stomach pain and the threat of bullying and teasing. 

- A combination of ‘buru’ (cloth made from old materials), kimbi (diaper) and moteti (sanitary pads) were reported as the main types of materials used by girls across all three islands. 

- Due to cultural taboos around menstrual blood, the disposal of sanitary materials in Kiribati is considered to be extremely important. 

- Safe sanitation facilities in schools are far below standard for menstruating girls. 

- Girls with disabilities face additional barriers when managing their menstruation. 

Recommendations include: 

- Assess and strengthen the menstruation, reproductive health and puberty sections of the school curriculum. 

- Develop teacher training on menstruation, Menstrual Hygiene Management and Sexual and Reproductive Health in collaboration with subject matter experts such as the Kiribati Family Health Association in line with UNESCOs ‘International technical guidance on sexuality education’. 

- Develop learning materials related to menstruation, puberty and reproductive health that will help support teachers in the classroom and promote comprehensive learning. 

- The Ministry of Education and stakeholders to monitor more closely and implement the national WASH in Schools Policy on continuous basis. 

- Develop a ‘Kiribati Girls Empowerment Programme’ that will contribute to girls’ empowerment and gender equality in Kiribati. 

- Advocate for community-wide MHM awareness raising that is inclusive of men, women, boys and girls across all age groups. 

- Integrate anti-bulling messaging related to menstruation into the ‘Respectful Relationships’ Curriculum as a culturally relevant example of gender stereotypes. 

- Consider the feasibility of providing free access to sanitary pads in school, preferably reusable sanitary pads.""" ;

    :description """Addressing the multiple dimensions of gender inequality requires commitments by policy-makers, practitioners and scholars to transformative practices. One challenge is to assemble a coherent conceptual framework from diverse knowledges and experiences. This article contains a framework that emerged from the authors’ involvement in changing market culture in the Pacific, which they name the ‘radical empowerment of women approach’. The article draws on detailed narratives from women market vendors and women-led new initiatives in marketplaces to explain the radical empowerment of women approach. 

The primary focus of recently developed projects for marketplaces in the Pacific is technical and infrastructural, which is insufficient for addressing gendered political and economic causes of poor market management and oppressive conditions for women vendors. The article explores the complex array of motives and effects of the desire to transform or improve marketplaces in the Pacific; and cautions against simplistic technical or infrastructural solutions. 

This paper also introduces the practice of working as a cooperative, hybrid research collaboration. The knowledges and analyses that each author brings to this issue demonstrate that substantive analysis generated from diverse and shifting ‘locations’ and roles, but underpinned by a shared vision of, and commitment to, gender justice, can provide distinctive policy and research insights.""" ;

The Tongen Inepwineu Counseling Center staff trained alongside the women and men health assistant trainees from the neighboring islands of Chuuk on how to provide better support to women and girl survivors of violence. For health assistants, this would pave the way for health services in rural locations to provide more comprehensive, necessary services for survivors.

    :description "Men’s control of coffee in Papua New Guinea is not only an artefact of colonial agricultural extension but also a consequence of gender norms and the system of land tenure that privileges men. Due to the historic association of coffee with ‘men’s business’, men tend to see coffee income as largely their own, despite women working in coffee production. This research with coffee smallholders showed that money was the most common reason for arguments between couples, with 37.8% of women and 38% of men saying this was what they argued over. When women talk about arguments over money, they are generally referring to arguments over the disposal of coffee income. Marital conflicts over coffee income, and especially men’s resource-depleting misuse of that income, are common, particularly during and following coffee harvesting season. In recognition of the unfairness involved, some men and women in the research communities saw a need to challenge the current gender order and to adopt more gender-equitable customs about the key resource of land. This includes the need for empowering women’s ownership of land, to give them security in the event of divorce." ;

The program draws on group therapy, community healing, and community development approaches. The program will be delivered within four Peer Support Circles in each community: 
1) Women’s Peer Support Circle. 
2) Young Women’s Peer Support Circle.
3) Men’s Peer Support Circle.
4) Young Men’s Peer Support Circle. 

Peer Support Circles create a safe space for members to heal from their pasts, learn and practice new skills, and create new pathways for their futures. Members are segregated by age and gender to increase the likelihood of feeling comfortable, enabling them to share and reflect on life experiences together. 

The program is delivered in three phases: Me; My relationships; and My community. Each phase takes roughly one year to complete. The community healing program will be implemented through local partner organisations in Simbu Province, Eastern Highlands Province, East Sepik Province and will also be extended to Central Province.  

After the initial community engagement and mobilisation, the program will commence with a baseline survey to establish the social norms in relation to gender-based violence and sorcery accusation-related violence will be undertaken.  An evaluation will be conducted after the first year to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and to adapt the program for the remaining two years. 

The paper titled, ‘Evidence-informed innovation for the prevention of family and community violence in Papua New Guinea’ has been written as a companion document to Oxfam Papua New Guinea’s Violence Prevention Strategy.

    :description """This paper draws explicit links between witchcraft and sorcery practices and beliefs in Melanesia, and poor development outcomes. It notes four distinct categories of impact: 

- The prevalence of these beliefs and practices mean that many are unwilling to engage fully in the cash economy or to exploit their particular skills or opportunities to the maximum, so as to avoid becoming a target of an attack by a sorcerer or witch motivated by envy. 

- The prevalence of sorcery and witchcraft as explanations for misfortunes of all kinds, including lack of development, means that blame and responsibility for these factors are often avoided by the government officials and politicians who in many cases are responsible for them. 

- Sorcery and witchcraft accusations and counter-accusations can lead to immediate negative development outcomes through individual acts of violence or by provoking and fuelling large-scale tribal conflicts. Such conflicts often have long-term consequences for food security and housing for individuals, families and sometimes whole villages. 

- The climates of distrust and suspicion imparted by sorcery and witchcraft beliefs and fears erode family and communal bonds, undermining community development projects and communal support networks in general. 

Given the pervasiveness of fear and mistrust that is haunting many communities in Melanesia, there is a need for development practitioners (including governments, non- government organisations and development organisations) to promote initiatives that seek to restore the social capital that is eroded by that fear and mistrust. 

The case material presented suggests that it is important for development practitioners to work, not only with communities where relations are obviously strained and where there are antagonisms and competition, but also more widely, as such fear and mistrust may not always be visible. Given the importance of Christianity in Melanesia, there is an important role for churches in building trust and establishing social capital in communities fractured by fear and mistrust. Such outside facilitators can act as a very useful catalyst in encouraging communities to reflect critically on such beliefs and practices and to search for alternative explanations for misfortune or failure in particular instances.""" ;

- Young women in Melanesia are subject to intimate forms of control. However educated and able they may be, family members continue to exert or seek to exert control over their behaviour and choices. 

- Young, educated Melanesian women derive solidarity and support from one another. This peer group support appears to be particularly important for women who have made countercultural ‘choices’ – for example, to remain single, leave violent partners or bring up children on their own. 

The strengths and capabilities of young educated women in Vanuatu suggest that there is untapped potential in their collective capacity. To date, this potential has been thwarted as a result of the active denigration of young women by older women and by pervasive, but misleading, discourses about women’s inability to co-operate with one another. In Vanuatu, partly as a consequence of this background, there is as yet no group focused on justice and equity for women such as those in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. 

There would be many benefits of local women creating a ‘chosen’ community with shared interests and purpose. the development of a ‘community of practice’ among young women in Vanuatu could work to promote increased status, respect and participation among young, educated ni-Vanuatu women, including those who do not conform to societal expectations about women’s roles.""" ;

The Do No Harm research explored the relationship between economic inclusion and empowerment programs, and violence against women. The key lessons learned from the research were that: 

- Working with men is necessary.

- There is an existing need for community-based gender transformative programs.

- Women’s economic empowerment programming must adopt a ‘do no harm’ approach. 

The guidance material kits use these lessons to assist program designers and implementers to integrate the elimination of violence against women into women’s economic empowerment programming.

The ‘Do No Harm: Integrating the Elimination of Violence Against Women into Women’s Economic Empowerment Programs Kit’ draws on the research in both Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. The ‘Do No Harm: Integrating the Elimination of Violence Against Women into Savings Clubs Kit’ focuses on the findings from savings clubs in Solomon Islands. 

The kits contain training guidelines and resources, including tools on gender and power analysis, safety mapping, and policies and processes for staff exposed to violence against women.

These women endure extremely heavy work burdens for, besides working to earn income, most continue to bear the responsibility for the agricultural labour that ensures sufficient food for the family to eat and for the unpaid house and care work (such as carrying water and firewood to the house, cooking, cleaning and childcare). 

The extent to which women are involved in household decision-making varies. The belief that the husband should be the head of the household is commonly held in Chimbu and Jiwaka, indicating the extent to which gender norms with negative outcomes for women are accepted by women themselves. Several women told of domineering husbands who made most decisions and told their wives what to do, in detail. Cases of husbands and wives discussing decisions together were rare, with few women citing this as a valued aspect of their marriage.  In Bougainville, joint decision-making is a feature of some marriages and women value sitting down with their husbands to discuss things, as well as helping
each other and working together. For some women, joint decision-making was a sign of a good marriage and of an ideal husband. Some of the male respondents interviewed during the research also considered joint decision-making an attribute of an ideal husband and said they practised this themselves. Although the claim of joint decision-making may give the impression of a cooperative household where the woman has a degree of respect and power, both male and female respondents confirmed that this sometimes
belies the fact that the wife actually has little power and is merely a rubber stamp for the man’s decisions. In some cases, joint decision-making does not extend to important decisions, especially when it comes to significant resources. 

The most violence reported during the research was connected to men’s alcohol consumption. The numerous reports of violence we heard confirm that when women bring economic resources into the household, they do not inevitably become more empowered or suffer less violence. 

An important implication of the research is that women’s economic empowerment programs should avoid minimalist initiatives — that is, they should not aim simply to give women access to economic opportunities without any consideration of gender and gender relations, especially the role of gender norms in marital relationships. Changes in marriage practices are having a negative impact on women in Jiwaka and Chimbu. The exchange of bride price is today widely understood to be a simple property transaction, in which the wife becomes the property of the husband, her purchaser. Husbands therefore consider themselves fully justified in treating their wives domineeringly and violently. The exchange of bride price also has the effect of increasing women’s work burden, since the bride price creates debts that must be repaid. Though such debts are meant to be borne by both partners, the responsibility for repaying them often falls solely on the wife. 

Men often feel excluded from initiatives that seek to improve women’s access to economic resources and this can result in backlash, which is one reason why women’s economic empowerment programs need to embrace ways of working with men. However, a greater need exists beyond fear of backlash. The failure to recognise that women are not a separate category from men but are intimately bound in relations with them in the household weakens the empowerment potential of women’s economic empowerment programming. But, above all, women should not be considered a separate category from men in the community either. Concentrating on men and women separately fails to address the need for community cohesiveness — that is, it fails to grasp the opportunity to build a strong, constructive and cooperative community. That women’s economic empowerment programming needs to be integrated more fully with community-based approaches that have a focus on violence against women is recognised internationally.

    :description """This research, exploring connections between women’s economic empowerment initiatives and increased violence against women in Solomon Islands, found that any equation between women’s economic empowerment and domestic violence is not always straightforward. 

The men and women interviewed identified a number of causes of marital conflict and violence, including sexual jealousy, disagreement over the disciplining of children, disagreement over spending priorities, men’s alcohol consumption, men’s failure to work, men coercing women to work harder and failure of wives to fulfil husbands’ expectations. The most violence reported during the research was connected to men’s alcohol consumption, which drains resources from the household, and so is questioned by women. 

While many of the women interviewed during the study were economically empowered to the extent that they had increased access to and control over economic resources through income generating activities or wage labour, this did not always translate into increased control over other areas of their lives. 

Powerful norms play an influential role in determining whether women’s greater earning capacity translates into more power for women in the household. The research found that women’s greater financial resources often enable men to lessen their own contributions to the household, or in some cases to contribute nothing at all. This allows men to use their money for their own personal consumption resource depleting behaviour that is often central to marital conflict. In such circumstances, when men contribute little either financially or by helping in the home, women’s increased income means a large increase in their work burden, now that income earning is added to their other customary duties. 

Although gender norms prescribe that women are largely responsible for unpaid household labour and childcare, various changes have brought some loosening of these norms. The broader social changes effected by Western education, Christianisation and colonisation, for example, have been influential in this, but some recent changes to gender norms have resulted from initiatives such as savings groups which have stimulated conversations about gender roles in communities. 

The research found, in communities where gender awareness training and forums for discussions of gender roles had been introduced alongside economic empowerment programming, there were instances of increased cooperation between men and women in households, which in some cases see men doing forms of labour usually associated with women. But the research also revealed that some of the changes occurring in gender roles are due to men’s opting out of contributing to the household, so that some women, out of necessity, are doing forms of labour traditionally associated with men. 

The research also examined the way financial decisions are made within households, finding that considerable variation exists in financial management and decision-making in Solomon Islands households. Income pooling and cooperative decision-making is common, although even within households that identified as having cooperative models of decision-making, the male head of the household sometimes ultimately controlled decisions. However, many respondents perceived that women were better financial managers, and so it was also common for women to manage pooled income. 

Ensuring that women’s access to and control over economic resources leads to increased control over other areas of their lives is critical for women’s economic empowerment. Key lessons to inform economic empowerment initiatives are: 

- Women’s savings groups are a potential pathway for women’s economic empowerment. 

- Working with men to challenge gender inequitable behaviour and norms is an imperative. 

- There is a need for community-based gender transformative programs. 

- Women’s economic empowerment programming should adopt a do no harm approach.""" ;

    :description """Even as the importance of women’s economic inclusion and empowerment is acknowledged and acted on, it is also known that such gains are not without risk; for increasing command over financial resources can expose women to domestic conflict and violence.

Few studies have addressed this issue comprehensively in the Pacific, with only a small amount of discussion of the relationship. Findings from research on the gender equality outcomes of economic growth in the Pacific suggest that in semi-subsistence Melanesian communities in Solomon Islands and Fiji, any cash in the hands of women can expose them to risk of violence by men, often in association with resource-depleting activities such as gambling and drinking. The relationship between gender-based violence and the provision of financial services is not yet fully understood.

Pacific women continue to experience poor development outcomes, with high levels of both economic exclusion and violence against them. Given this, and the policy priority attached to sustainable economic development in the region, understanding what factors enhance women’s economic inclusion and empowerment in the fullest sense, and what factors mitigate against this, is essential to enabling change that also advances security. 

Research that indicates clearly to donor agencies what needs to be incorporated in the design and implementation of economic empowerment initiatives, and in organisational policies, in order to minimise possible harm and to maximise positive gender equality outcomes will assist them to meet their minimum ethical responsibility to do no harm.""" ;

- What is generally understood to be the content of the due diligence principle - by governments, civil society advocates, and international legal scholars and experts working on violence against women? 

- How can compliance with this obligation be monitored, assessed and evaluated – by governments, civil society advocates and international legal scholars and experts working on violence against women? 

- How are States complying with their due diligence obligation to prevent, protect against, prosecute, punish and provide redress for acts of violence against women? 

- What are good practices to eliminate violence against women, globally and regionally? 

The global component consists of literature review, which focus on studying the development and evolution of the due diligence principle in international law and how it is being commonly applied today. It also looks at the context of violence against women, its historical roots of exclusion and invisibility in the human rights discourse, as well as its later recognition as a violation of human rights. The global component was further strengthened by an expert meeting held in 2011, in Boston USA. The meeting brought together a wide array of experts from around the world, and from various disciplines and fields (e.g. law, sociology, academia, civil society, and inter-governmental).

- In 2010 the Pacific region lost 65 percent in potential human development due to gender inequality. But this average hides considerable regional differences. 

- Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands have high gender inequality, but perhaps surprisingly, so do the Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru. 

- Polynesia averages the same as high human development nations, with an average loss of 57 percent in potential human development due to gender inequality. 

- Cook Islands, Niue and Fiji have the least gender inequality of the Pacific region. 

- Gender inequality in Solomon Islands appears to have increased considerably due to the ethnic conflict limiting women’s participation in the work force and access to education. 

- High maternal mortality rates correlate with a lower percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel. However, Samoa and Tonga have high maternal mortality rates despite nearly 100 percent of births attended by skilled health professionals. 

- In Melanesia, Papua New Guinea has the worst female to male education rates (12 percent to 24 percent), followed by Solomon Islands (32 percent to 38 percent). 

- High fertility rates across the Pacific suggest an essentially reproductive role for women, which limit economic and political participation. 

- In developed countries, life expectancy for women is 5 to 10 years higher than men. Most Pacific nations fall below this norm, but especially PNG and Solomon Islands (+1 year).""" ;

- Family and Sexual Violence Units (FSVUs) are highly relevant for expanding services to survivors of family and sexual violence (FSV). 

- The effectiveness of FSVU services is constrained by internalised gender norms of male dominance and authority and women’s dependence and obedience. These internalised gender norms have a profound impact on the quality of services offered to FSVU survivors.  

- FSVUs need to improve their timeliness of response to cases, as well as the information they provide to survivors about the FSVU roles, responsibilities and processes related to FSV cases, and the services that network partners provide to FSV survivors. 

- There are systematic weaknesses and failures in holding perpetrators accountable for FSV and rarely are there immediate arrests or removal. 

- Despite progress, much needs to be done for FSVUs to achieve efficiency in the delivering of FSVU services. 

- Female staffing within FSVUs has helped to increase the number of FSV cases reported. 

- All FSVU officers have received training; however, the levels of skills vary and there is no systematised training plan for FSVU staff and for RPNGC staff more broadly on the Constabulary’s response to FSV. 

- Few FSVU cases are investigated because: 
- FSVU staff are overloaded with the number of cases received. 
- Most FSVU cases are not indictable and have limited chances of making it to the prosecution stage. 
- The survivor withdraws the case or accepts compensation. 
- Police disinterest and/or lack of FSVU resources cause the matter to falter prior to the prosecution stage. 

- Those cases investigated are due to the strong determination of a survivor to get the offender arrested and prosecuted. Compensation and mediation are embedded in the FSVU processes. 

- The 8 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday opening hours are inadequate as they can require the survivor to return to police station several times, delaying the provision of urgent protection services. 

- There is an FSV referral system in place, of which FSVUs are an integral part. 

- The RPNGC has demonstrated ownership towards a response to FSV by introducing FSVUs across 15 police stations. 

- More needs to be done for FSVUs to have an impact in offering improved safety, stability and crime prevention to FSV survivors. 

- Much needs to be done in order to improve the quality of services offered by FSVUs.

    :description """Poverty data in Fiji is derived from household income and expenditure data, collected via periodic Household Income and Expenditure Surveys. Given gender inequality within households can be significant, assessing individual poverty by using household data and then assuming all household members have the same access to resources and opportunities is problematic. Household-level measurement also means accurate disaggregation of data is impossible. This makes the work of policy makers and advocates harder, masking differences rather than revealing them so they can be addressed. Individual-level measurement is essential to fully understand poverty and inequality, and the relationship between gender and poverty. The Individual Deprivation Measure (IDM) is a new, gender-sensitive and multidimensional measure of poverty. The measure assesses deprivation at the individual level, in relation to 15 key dimensions of life, making it possible to see who is poor, in what way and to what extent. In 2014, the Australian Government funded the first IDM study (beyond the initial proof of concept trial in the Philippines), to explore what additional insights into deprivation in Fiji could be gained by individual-level, gender-sensitive poverty measurement. This work was undertaken by the IWDA, working with the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. The IDM Fiji study confirmed the measure’s potential to reveal gender differences within the household: 

- 91% of women reported exposure to fumes related to cooking and heating, compared with 65% of men. 

- Women on average were exposed to 1 hour and 45 minutes per day of fumes related to cooking and heating, compared to an average of 24 minutes per day for men. 

- More women than men suffered health problems linked to unclean cooking and heating fuel (25% compared with 12%). Of those who suffered health problems, women were more likely to suffer more severe consequences. These findings reflect not just household variables such as location/type of kitchen and fuel used, but also the implications of a gendered and unequal distribution of household responsibilities, with women having primary responsibilities for domestic work. 

- Women were more likely than men to be extremely deprived and very deprived in Voice (the ability to raise concerns and effect change in their community). Men were twice as likely to be not deprived at all in this dimension. The gender difference in Voice was largest in urban areas.

- Nearly half the men in the sample (48%) reported full control over
personal decisions, compared to only 25% of women. Women
were more likely than men to report no control over personal
decisions (5% compared with 1.4%).""" ;

The research involved community focus group discussions town-hall style meetings, individual in-depth semi-structured interviews and meetings with service providers including police, the public solicitor’s office, schools and Femili PNG.

The research findings make clear:

- survivors of violence take multiple financial and social considerations into account before seeking assistance;

- that there are various informal and formal support mechanisms available and used;

- that financial hardship is both a barrier to seeking assistance and often the result for families when separated;

- that family and sexual violence and financial hardship negatively impacts school attendance;

- that despite minimal resources many schools in Lae are supporting students impacted by family and sexual violence in responsive and innovative ways;

- that women who did seek police support usually received it, and that police usually take a mediating rather than criminal justice approach which was in accordance with the wishes of most survivors; and

- that women need more information on what assistance is available and more help to access assistance.""" ;

    :description """In rural Papua New Guinea, where over 80 per cent of the population live, nearly 50 per cent of women birth outside of a health centre. One out of 25 women dies of pregnancy related causes and 52 babies out of every 1000 born die before their first birthday.  For every woman who dies in childbirth or pregnancy, another 30 will suffer lifelong pain or disability from pregnancy-related complications. These alarmingly high death rates are partly the result of health centres being many hours walk away from remote communities and lacking in basic drugs, supplies and suitably trained staff. They are also the result of ingrained cultural norms that restrict women’s autonomy, which can lead to delays, or even prevent, women seeking health care. 

The Highlands Sexual, Reproductive and Maternal Health project aimed to meaningfully and sustainably improve the health and wellbeing of women, their families and communities in targeted rural areas of Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea. The project used a Community Workshop Series approach and built on the successes and learnings of the previous Maternal and Infant Health project implemented in the Highlands.  The rights-based approach supported the National Department of Health sector gender policy to enhance women’s decision-making in relation to health seeking practices; educating women and men about their right to health and supporting their family and spouses to seek care; and improving gender integration into health services so that women, men, boys and girls can access gender-sensitive care.

    :description """This report details data from 6,176 icidents of gender-based or sorcery accussation-related violence collected by seven women’s and human rights defenders’ organisations working across five provinces in Papua New Guinea.  These organisations provide safe houses, counselling and crisis support to survivors of violence.  The data analysis seeks to understand the type of violence inflicted, who is affected and who are reported as the perpetrators.

Women are more affected by violence than men with 78% of women being complainants. When the complainant was in an
intimate partner relationship 84% were female. 

Financial disagreements emerged as a key cause of violence, and mostly occurred in intimate partner relationships. Women
were mostly affected (84.1%), and the majority of complainants were not in formal employment (83.6%). However, a third of
perpetrators (32.1%) were in formal employment. This suggest that there is disagreement with the way money is spent within
the family, and that this often results in violence in the home.

The analysis showed that sorcery accusations affect men and women almost equally. In addition, sorcery accusations
are often directed towards families and perpetrators are more likely to be immediate family members or known community
members. The data also showed that widow(er)s were strongly affected by sorcery related accusations and violence.

Recommnedations from the data analysis are:

- Greater investment by government to implement the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender Based Violence
2016-2025, particularly the following areas:
-  Gender responsive budgeting of national and local budgets, increased funding going towards projects which meet women
and girls needs.
-  Funding to be allocated to initiatives which focus on addressing sorcery related violence.
-  Government recognition and support of the front line human rights defenders and organisations.
- Continue to establish more Family Support Centres and Family Sexual Violence Units in every Province and the establishment
of national shelters.

- Increased commitment from government in implementing the Gender Equality and Social Inclusion policy at all levels of
government and provision of support/incentives to provincial and local governments who take the lead in innovative practices.
to reduce the gender disparity within the work force.

- Programs to increase women’s economic empowerment may reduce GBV by increasing women’s bargaining power and ability to leave abusive relationships, though there are also risks that increased empowerment could threaten household patriarchies and exacerbate violence. 

- Gender norms and attitudes are shaped by history andcontext, and are often resistant to change. Social norms about gender roles and violence can influence the risk of experiencing GBV. Since gendered expectations and limitations on agency can establish a pattern of subordination and voicelessness, changing norms can be an important part of a comprehensive approach to violence prevention. Creating groups or a safe space where participants can meet and have positive interactions is an important component of many programmatic approaches to changing behaviors, attitudes and norms related to violence. 

- Involving men in interventions that aim to empower women and reduce violence can be critical. 

- For any intervention it is important to consider the duration (length of intervention) and frequency (of activities) needed to achieve the desired outcome. The evidence base on this is still very small; few interventions have compared multiple frequencies and durations.""" ;

Although the research did not focus specifically on financial inclusion, some of the data provides an understanding of the impediments to accessing financial services facing highlands communities, particularly women. 

Considering the importance given to financial inclusion in women’s economic empowerment programming by donors and other development practitioners, this research highlights that attention is needed to increase women’s literacy and numeracy.

    :description """This review looks at major trends in spending (comparing women and men), the chief barriers to women having more income and control of their finances, and the key opportunities for programs to address economic empowerment of women at household and community levels. 

Much of the available evidence on women’s economic situation in the Pacific comes from household income and expenditure surveys, which do not usually disaggregate on the grounds of gender. While there are some data about women’s income, most analysis of expenditure is conducted at the household level and it is therefore difficult to examine trends in women and men’s spending.  

Compared with other parts of the world, women in the Pacific region experience limited economic empowerment. In most Pacific countries, women tend to be under-represented in the formal workforce, spend more time doing household work, and are paid less than men.  Female-headed households are twice as likely to be in poverty than male-headed households.  

Key barriers to women’s economic empowerment include poor educational attainment, patriarchal norms, customary law and a lack of land/property rights, a lack of access to finance, a lack of skills and knowledge, and poor infrastructure. 

 Few studies have examined which economic empowerment strategies offer the best opportunities for success in Pacific countries. Two studies advocate supporting female financial literacy training as a means to improving the efficacy of female-targeted microfinance strategies. The broader literature on women’s economic empowerment emphasises the importance of tackling multiple constraints when designing women’s economic empowerment programs.""" ;

More research needs to examine how alcohol affects gendered violence in relation to shifting ethno-cultural environments and emerging marital practices. Equally, how alcohol contributes to security-sector clashes is a critical question for policy actors interested in mitigating conflict.

However, increased feelings of relative poverty may trigger greater intra-household tension. While increased perceptions of relative poverty cause women to want more household decision-making authority, men’s attitudes toward women’s roles in decision making are unchanged.

Results underscore the complicated nature of gender attitudes, and how support for women’s economic participation may rise without simultaneous increases in women’s agency in decision making.""" ;

Over the last decade, young women’s fertility rates (ages 15-19) across the Pacific have declined in eight countries. However, in five countries (Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) rates have remained high, at over 50 of births to women 15-19 years per 1,000 women 15-19 years. 

Investing in adolescent girls’ and young women’s SRHR will contribute to preventing teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections including HIV. Ultimately, however, such interventions can also enable and encourage girls to stay in schools; it will improve their understanding of their rights to live free from violence; equip them with understanding about safe options and enhance their ability to make informed choices. 

A number of initiatives are underway across the Pacific to empower girls and young women, address the multi-faceted barriers that young people face in their access to information and services and to challenge the stigma that teenagers confront when they are pregnant or young mothers: Enhancing access to and delivery of SRHR, including contraception, information and services in rural areas, informal settlements and outer islands; Institutionalising Comprehensive Sexuality Education in the school curricula for primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutes; Providing CSE for out of school youths, parents and communities; Creating enabling environments for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by addressing its underlying determinants including by involving young people in decision making processes.""" ;

    :description """This paper examines the experience and lessons of three projects implemented by CARE International in Papua New Guinea to inform best practice in inclusive governance programming in the future. CARE’s governance work enables citizens (the “grassroots”) and government (representative as well as the civil service) to come together, disrupting negative or destructive cycles of distrust, inaction and disempowerment. CARE’s work has built capacity (skills, knowledge and processes) and worked with the incentives, motivations or drivers for people (grassroots and government, women and men) to start coming together in non-adversarial ways, rebuilding (or indeed building) the social compact for the benefit of future development. CARE governance projects have collaboratively developed appropriate processes, tools and materials for training, reflection and implementation for more inclusive governance; materials that can be used by government (and that are sought by government) to help government systems of governance and collective community action to go forward even in the absence of intensive NGO led facilitation. The projects have sought ‘good enough governance’ rather than perfect governance. CARE’s governance projects have sought to help people make the changes that are possible because of the help of CARE as an external, neutral and trusted organisation, and that can begin to enable more transparent, accountable and constructive cycles of governance. 

There remain significant challenges in governance programming. There are governance factors at play that are beyond the scope of a single NGO to influence – for example, to track and improve the reliability of both development and function grants even reaching Districts and lower levels of government; and a continually and unpredictably changing legislative and policy environment. There is international recognition that inclusive governance work (or indeed development work in general) in highly complex settings such as Papua New Guiena is necessarily incremental and requires flexibility and long-term commitment, and yet donor requirements rarely enable the level of flexibility in programming, nor funding timeframes necessary for the greatest gains to be made.""" ;

Enhancing women’s economic empowerment is strategic for long-term, equity, growth, and sustainability. UN Women research has shown that improving the economic status of women leads to increased economic activity in communities and positive ripple effects for the whole nation. Marketplaces are key sites for women’s economic empowerment as well as national poverty reduction. Marketplaces are often dominated by rural and urban women vendors whose cash incomes constitute a significant part of the income of poor households. Market places also provide a significant revenue stream for local councils. However the economic contribution markets and market traders make to local and national economies is not often recognised by national and local governments. For the most part, market vendors, especially women, face unhealthy and unsafe work environments. Violence against women is widely reported. Despite the dominance of women market vendors, women are often excluded from market governance and decision making." ;

- More than 2 in 3 (68%) ever-partnered women aged 15–49 reported experiencing physical or sexual violence, or both, by an intimate partner. 

- 47% of women aged 15–49 who had ever been in a relationship reported experiencing emotional abuse by a partner at least once. Almost 1 in 3 women (30%) experienced emotional abuse in the 12 months prior to the interview. 

- Almost all (90%) ever-partnered women aged 15–49 reported experiencing at least one form of controlling behaviour by an intimate partner. 

- Among women aged 15–49, 11% reported experiencing physical violence by someone other than an intimate partner, and 10% reported experiencing sexual non-partner violence. The most commonly mentioned perpetrators of physical violence were the respondent’s male family members, in particular her father or stepfather. The most commonly mentioned perpetrators of sexual violence were male acquaintances (such as family friends, work colleagues) and strangers. 

- Approximately 20% of women who reported that they had ever had sexual intercourse reported that their first sexual experience was either coerced or forced and the younger the girl at first sexual encounter, the more likely sex was forced. 

The relatively high prevalence of intimate partner violence in Kiribati likely relates to a multitude of factors at all levels of society. Some significant contributors may include: 

- The acceptability of violence against women: the majority of women in Kiribati believe that a man is justified in beating his wife under some circumstances (in particular for infidelity and disobedience). 

- The normalisation of controlling behaviours within intimate partner relationships: 90% of women reported that they had experienced at least one act of controlling behaviour by a partner. • The fact that physical punishment is often used as a form of disciplining women who are seen as transgressing their prescribed gender roles. 

- The practice of physically disciplining children: children may learn from a young age that physical violence is normal (cycle of violence). 

- The fact that current law does not define partner violence as a crime. 

- The lack of formal support services available, which also makes it difficult for women to seek help.""" ;

- Women in the civil service and on boards. 

- Women’s leadership for economic empowerment. 

- Women’s leadership to improve women’s and children’s safety.

Lessons learned are: 

- Women in leadership is typically seen through a rather narrow lens of national political leadership. There are many layers of political leadership and women have tended to excel at the community and sub-national levels where there is relatively little support for them. 

- Getting women in parliament is not an end in itself. Women need ongoing support in such positions. 

- Little attention has been paid to encouraging and nurturing women in middle-level and senior management in the public services of Pacific Island countries. 

- There is a need for structured mentoring programs in the private sector to support women. 

- Women need to work in partnership with men to gain their support and to have them as champions. 

- While many initiatives rely on development partner support, some are locally initiated and are self-sustaining, some with private sector support. 

- There are many activities in the leadership arena. This points to a need for coordination at national and regional levels in order to avoid duplication in order to make the best use of limited resources and also to fill any gaps. 

- Young women have specific areas of interest and they should be encouraged and supported. 

- Work to reduce legislative and policy barriers to gender equality needs to be ongoing in order to set an enabling platform for women in decision-making and leadership roles.""" ;

    :description """This mapping paper includes examples of efforts by the private sector in the Pacific to address violence against women and provides examples of how States can begin to calculate the costs of violence to a nation’s economy. While there are some great examples of private sector initiatives, there is little information available on the successes and impacts of these initiatives.  

There is limited analysis of the costs of violence on the business sector and on national economies. Evidence of costs to businesses of violence would help create awareness of both the economic and social imperatives to address violence against women and help to inform and mobilise support from government and private sector.  

The private sector needs to be open to working with both State and non-State actors in addressing violence including women’s organisations that have expertise in addressing violence against women. 

Participation of women is needed to develop private sector responses that really address women’s lived realities. Women employees, community members and women’s groups need to be engaged and involved in the development of private sector responses. 

Outside Papua New Guinea and perhaps Fiji, private sector organisations are less networked globally; specific assistance in networking between private sector organisations should be supported, including for small and medium scale businesses. 

Several toolkits / frameworks and implementation guides exist. These can be further developed for the Pacific, specifically for small island states where small and medium industries often do not have large supportive corporate structures.  

It is better for the private sector to be ‘proactive’ in developing policies, rather than only developing them after a crisis situation occurs. Private sector organisations can support each other with lessons learned and examples, sharing company practices as appropriate. 

Given the strength, diversity and outreach of the private sector, this sector can be a leading player in community responses, highlighting the issues of violence against women, and being an active partner in advocating for social change to address violence against women and increase women’s economic empowerment.""" ;

Fieldwork was carried out in six countries — Angola, Fiji, Indonesia, Malawi, Mozambique and the Philippines — in order to understand how the poorest people in some very poor countries viewed poverty and related hardships, and to what extent they saw these as gendered. This paper focuses only on fieldwork conducted in Fiji." ;

- Partnership development and collection of background data. 

- Fieldwork and feedback. 

- A cost-calculation and presentation phase.

- Girls in Kiribati lack knowledge about menstruation and reproductive health as they transition into adolescence and adulthood. 

- Poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) contributes to girls being unable to manage their menstruation in Kiribati schools. 

- It is often considered taboo for men and boys to talk about menstruation or interact with  menstruating girls and women. 

- Strong beliefs about menstruation in Kiribati culture can have a very positive effect on girls. However, some behavioural restrictions have potentially harmful outcomes. 

- Girls in Kiribati schools find it difficult to manage their menstrual pain. 

- Key members of the school leadership community also lack knowledge about menstrual health and hygiene, most notably parents and teachers. 

Recommendations for school leaders include: 

- Ensuring the school toilets are safe, secure, private and hygienic. Encouraging teachers to talk about menstruation and female health with students. 

- Acting as role models. 

- Ensuring easy access for girls to sanitary pads and pain relief. 

- Disciplining bad behaviours.

- 33% of married or ever partnered women are victims of physical violence.

    :description """In 2013, widespread publicity given to the deaths of two women accused of witchcraft in Papua New Guinea drew international and national attention to the problem of sorcery and witchcraft accusation–related violence. In the face of mounting pressure to take action, including the national haus krai protest calling for an end to violence against women, the government responded by repealing the Sorcery Act 1971 and creating a new provision in the Criminal Code Act 1974 (Chapter 262). Section 229A of the Criminal Code Act provides that any person who intentionally kills another person on account of an accusation of sorcery is guilty of wilful murder, for which the penalty is death. 

There was recognition, both within the government and the wider community, that these problems cannot be solved solely at a legislative level, and must rather involve a holistic response. 

This short paper outlines the substance of, and steps leading to, the drafting of a national action plan to provide a concrete foundation for this holistic response to sorcery accusation-related violence. The plan has five core areas: legal and protection; health; advocacy and communication; care and counselling; and research. Each area contains some key recommendations and sets out concrete activities to be taken in both the short and medium term to implement the recommendations. 

The action plan also allocates specific responsibilities to particular departments and organisations, establishes time frames, and highlights the resources (human and financial) that are necessary or available to implement them.""" ;

- Social context of market trade in the Pacific. 

- Challenges faced by Pacific Island market traders. 

- Recommendations for improving Pacific Island markets. 

The literature review contains some general comments about market trade across the Pacific, followed by specific information for each Pacific Island country, where available. The amount of information available on each Pacific Island country varies. The most comprehensive information comes from countries with larger population sizes and associated great likelihood of study by academic researchers and development agencies. Papua New Guinea is thus overrepresented in studies of market trade. Limited information is available on Polynesia, and almost nothing has been published on Micronesia. Countries in these areas would prove fertile sites for future research on market trade.

    :description """This review looks at progress toward the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action’s goals on the following themes: 

- Sexual and reproductive health and rights. 

- Health, morbidity and mortality. 

- Family wellbeing and society. 

- Gender and empowering women. 

- Population and Sustainable development. 

- Population change and social development challenges. 

- Urbanisation and internal migration. 

- International migration and development. 

- Population development and education. 

The findings of the ICPD Global Survey Beyond 2014 highlight both the successes and formidable challenges Pacific nations have faced in meeting the ICPD’s goals. The population growth rates of some countries are still too high to ensure viable, sustainable futures and the slow rate of economic development has not kept pace with population growth. The realisation of rights and social protection for vulnerable groups such as women and children, the elderly, youth and people with disabilities is still inadequate. Management of burgeoning urbanisation and development of planning for migration, both internal and international, remain limited. Integrated and comprehensive approaches to achieving reproductive rights and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) across the region are yet to be fully established, and the integration of population issues into education systems is still under development. Enabling women to enjoy full participation in political and economic life remains elusive for most Pacific island countries and gender based violence is reported as prevalent in many countries. 

Despite these continuing challenges, there have been notable signs of progress. The number of countries with national population policies is steadily increasing. SRH programmes have received considerable attention and the integration of SRH into primary health programmes has also improved. However, there is a need to improve the legal and policy framework with respect to the protection of rights, ensuring that vulnerable groups, especially persons with disabilities, have access to SRH services. The level of SRH integration into primary health care could also be strengthened to give those who live on outer islands and remote rural communities greater access to information and services. Teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), family planning services, addressing unmet need and policy were also a priority for most countries. Given the high rates of STIs in the Pacific this remains a key area to maintain national and regional support.""" ;

The report looks certain stakeholders have leadership roles. The evaluation of current policies, laws, and programs in the Pacific for women and girls with disabilities and the identification of further work required by the various stakeholders focus on a rights-based approach relevant to supporting women and girls with disabilities. 

Comprehensive rights-based responses will be required to change attitudes and cultural practices where they result in discrimination, and to end the poverty, isolation, violence and abuse suffered by many women and girls with disabilities. While governments must take a leadership role, other stakeholders also have important roles to play. 

In particular, urgent work is needed to: 

- Develop and implement laws, policies and programs that advance the rights of women and girls with disabilities. 

- Raise the educational attainment of girls with disabilities. 

- Increase access to comprehensive and quality health care for women and girls with disabilities. 

- Reduce of unemployment of women with disability. 
•Improve access to all buildings and transportation. 

This can best be done with a series of measures that promote the mainstreaming of support and activities for women and girls with disabilities together with a series of targeted actions. Such work must be complemented with continuous awareness raising to change negative attitudes towards them.""" ;

- Develop and implement gender-sensitive responses to COVID-19. 

- Support women’ economic security. 

- Prioritise support to domestic violence survivors. 

- Ensure continued access to health services. 

The contribution of both women and men is essential to effective crisis response. There is a need to include women, alongside men, in response planning as leaders, policy makers and care givers to assist with key decision making. It is important to understand that women and men are impacted differently by a crisis like the COVID19 pandemic. 

During a crisis women and girls are disproportionately impacted and typically face even higher rates of violence and sexual abuse, undertake more unpaid domestic work, access fewer essential health services and are more vulnerable to economic hardship. 

Only some Pacific Island countries and territories have so far reported COVID-19 cases but all have implemented some form of COVID-19 response such as border closures, curfews or other restrictions. These responses, moreso than the virus itself, will likely have a greater effect on the Pacific and its resilience to the crisis. Monitoring and assessing the gendered impacts of the COVID-19 response will require consideration of both the negative impacts of the response on many women (such as lockdown restrictions limiting access to employment and services) and aspects of the response that will benefit women (such as government subsidies accessible by women).""" ;

All people will be impacted in some way and must adapt to the pandemic, however men and women – or different groups of men and women – will not all be affected in the same ways. This is due to women and men play different roles and have different responsibilities in their homes and communities. 

Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by crises. Women and girls are likely to: face even higher rates of domestic violence and sexual abuse; are more vulnerable to economic hardship as income generation activities women perform are disrupted; have increased unpaid in the household due to the closure of schools and have reduced access to essential health services. It is important to keep track of how all the different segments of the population are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how mitigation measures are affecting people’s lives.

1. Health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    :description """Outside of national politics, Pacific women are often visible as leaders. The study found that Pacific women from places as far afield as Bougainville and Samoa are leaders in diverse fields including local government, civil service, private business, and civil society. 

Leadership in Pacific women’s lives does not fit nicely into one category. Few women in the study were only leaders in local government or in business. For most of the women in the study, leadership began at an early age and continues to be expressed across many areas of their lives, for example within their extended family or in their church. These spaces and women’s roles within them need to be considered when planning initiatives to support Pacific women leaders. 

Local government in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands is already an important entry point for women’s political leadership. Both countries have women elected into local government. The example of Bougainville is especially important because it has had its own indigenous special measures in place for women in politics since independence. Their experiences can be used to better understand how women can enter politics and also may be a stepping-stone into other types of leadership. 

Across most of the countries, critical women actors are already working together and with certain men, to successfully lobby for policy and legislative reform at national and local levels. This type of work may be carried out discreetly through informal networks as in the Solomon Islands or openly through formal networks as in Samoa with WinLa. 

Culture is often cited as a barrier for women’s leadership in the Pacific. In some cases, culture does seem to be a real barrier for women and men to support women leaders. But such a view of Pacific cultures may be too rigid to be true in all situations. Many Pacific women do use or see potential to use culture to access spaces of leadership or to gain changes in policy, practice or legislation that substantively support women’s rights.""" ;

    :description "Health pandemics have specific and severe impacts on the lives of women and girls. Since the COVID-19 outbreak first had reported cases, the gendered impacts began being documented in the Pacific and across the world. Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by crises. Existing gender inequalities are exacerbated during a crisis, with the result that women and girls face even higher rates of violence, sexual abuse and control from their husbands, partners and families. Women are expected to undertake more unpaid domestic work, are less able to access essential health services and are more vulnerable to economic hardship. Crises such as disease outbreaks heighten the vulnerabilities of different groups, accentuating inequalities and leading to the neglect of the needs and rights of the most marginalised. This includes women and girls living in poverty, migrants, people with disabilities, the elderly and people of diverse sexual orientation, gender identity and expression (SOGIE). Recognising the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on marginalised groups is vital to ensure an effective health response which does not further endanger and exclude already vulnerable groups. Failing to take into consideration the specific impacts of COVID-19 on women and girls will result in a response which is less effective and does not meet the needs and requirements of half the population. Experience from past outbreaks such as the Ebola and Zika outbreaks have demonstrated the vital importance of incorporating a gender lens in to planning, response and re-building to ensure health interventions and humanitarian response are effective and promote gender equality.  Recognising how COVID-19 affects women and men differently is fundamental to an effective response in health services and health communications, law and justice, security and education." ;

Disrupted education: School closures have disrupted girl’s learning and they are less able than boys to access online learning options. Girls are experiencing increased pressure to undertake domestic labour and care responsibilities for their families.
Increased anxiety and loneliness: Particular impacts related to adolescent girl’s age and developmental stage include: a loss of peer support, leading to depression and anxiety; an increased propensity to boredom and risk-taking behaviours; and for those with online access, an increased exposure to predators, online harassment, exploitation and bullying.
Feeling isolated and unsafe at home and online: Prolonged school closures and economic recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to significantly increase the risk of gender-based violence, early and forced marriage, sexual exploitation and child labour.
Increased care burden at home: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the burden of care on women and girls. Caring for siblings and children in the community, especially during school closures, and additional household work often falls to adolescent girls. This is because they are traditionally expected to assist their mothers and female relatives undertake the vast majority of unpaid domestic labour and childcare.
Disrupted access to menstrual hygiene and sexual health services: Restricted movement decreases access to sexual and reproductive health information and services, while increasingly crowded living conditions impinges on girl’s access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and menstrual hygiene management.""" ;

    :description """In the Pacific region 56 per cent of the population is under the age of 25. Pacific young people have diverse needs, opportunities and experiences, living as they do across 20,000 islands around the Pacific Ocean. This dynamic group of young people live in urban and rural areas, on remote islands and in large cities. They have diverse sexualities and gender identities. They are young people living with disabilities, they are sex workers, they are young women and men living with HIV and AIDS. They are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, they are students, politicians, homemakers and business people. They are young mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters and daughters and sons. They face discrimination due to multiple, intersecting challenges, such as poverty, migration, climate change, religion, ethnicity, gender and age. 

One thing that too many Pacific Island young people share is a disproportionate burden of poor sexual and reproductive health and rights. There are high rates of adolescent pregnancies, endemic levels of sexual and gender based violence and a growing prevalence of sexually transmitted infections. Restrictive abortion laws in most countries mean information about abortions, including the prevalence and effects of unsafe abortion, is limited. Restrictive laws around sexual orientation and gender identity, also prevent many young people from accessing their sexual and health rights. 

These sexual and reproductive health and rights challenges directly contribute to a wide range of negative short and long-term consequences for the health and wellbeing of Pacific young people, their families and communities. It is also increasingly contributing to broader social and economic challenges that significantly hinder the development of Pacific Island Countries and Territories. Therefore, Pacific Island Countries are unlikely to reach their development goals without addressing the sexual and reproductive rights and health of their young people.""" ;

    :description """Papuan perspectives on family planning have historically emphasised political concerns that reflect the tensions between the Indonesian state and indigenous rights – Papuans have questioned both the need for them to limit their population size and the propriety of the state to intervene in their reproductive matters. Family planning in Indonesia is said to have stagnated, and rates of contraceptive use in Tanah Papua (the western half of the island of New Guinea, currently comprising the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua) are considerably lower than the Indonesian average. 

A revived family planning agenda appears imminent, spurred on by new global commitments such as the Family Planning 2020 campaign and increased funding from international organisations. This paper draws on ethnographic research conducted in two sites in Tanah Papua – Manokwari, a coastal city, and Wamena, a highlands hub – to explore how Papuans, particularly youth, are likely to react to family planning.

 By discussing political, cultural, gendered, and religious facets of family planning, this paper corrects the notion that “access” to family planning in Papua can be primarily understood in terms of geography and infrastructure, and points to other factors that may shape Papuans’ uptake of family planning. The paper reveals that while some of Papuans’ political concerns have shifted, there remain important unanswered questions and opportunities for dialogue that define the ideological space of the family planning revival in Tanah Papua.""" ;

It analyses the impacts of three issues that emerged as common themes in discussions around women’s participation in political decision making in Bougainville: 

- The impact of the shift to a limited preferential voting electoral system on political campaigning and the election of women.

- The influence of Bougainville’s matrilineal land ownership traditions on the campaigns and results of women candidates.

While limited preferential voting system has resulted in the election of women in some circumstances, it is by no means a panacea for women’s political under-representation.

    :description """Agriculture constitutes over 65% of the country’s TOP $26 million exports (approximately AU$16 million) and accounts for 14% of Tonga’s GDP. Two-thirds of Tonga’s households are involved in agricultural production, with approximately 2.4% of households operating as commercial producers in the formal economy. Another 39% of households produce some crops to sell through markets and roadside stalls in the informal economy. 

Agricultural exports rely heavily on horticultural crops, and the PHAMA program is focussed on supporting these, but there has been minimal investigation of the gender aspects of the value chains. It was recognised that a basic gender analysis was required to better inform future support by the PHAMA program and other relevant donor or Government of Tonga led programs. 

In developing the scope of the analysis, it was also identified that handicraft (e.g. woven mats) production and sales was anecdotally a significant source of income for women throughout Tonga but due to being largely informal the trade was not reflected in official statistics such as export volumes or earnings. Hence it was agreed as useful to also consider the production and sale of handicrafts within this analysis. With a focus on these value chains, the analysis was to identify the respective roles, responsibilities, expectations and challenges of women (and men) and recommend specific aspects or approaches for the PHAMA or other programs to better address gender issues and in particular women’s economic empowerment. It was also to include a summary of the gender context in Tonga and relevant community, donor or Government of Tonga led programs or activities aimed at addressing gender issues. 

The PHAMA Program is in some ways undermined by a design document written prior to an important shift in gender equality programming at the Australian department of Foreign Affaris and Trade. While the Program is not necessarily entrenching gender and social inequality and vulnerability, nor has it (until now) taken deliberate steps to factor gender into strategic planning. Gender should be a core consideration in the design of any future program. In the meantime, a gender focus could be introduced into PHAMA’s final annual strategic plan, with associated budget allocations. PHAMA should also continue to seek sex-disaggregated data as part of its monitoring and evaluation efforts.""" ;

    :description """Samoan women have achieved approximate equality to men in most modern spheres of government and the economy, but have never succeeded in winning more than five seats in the 49-seat parliament. Samoa has been among the countries ranked lowest in the world for women’s representation in parliament: in 2015 it ranked 128 out of 140 countries.

This comprehensive research consisted of:

- A nationwide survey of women’s participation in political and economic village-based organisations, covering all villages and sub-villages in Samoa.

- A qualitative study of village organisation in a sample of 30 villages with and without formal obstacles to women’s participation in village government.

- Interviews of women candidates who have stood for past elections.

The research found that the system of traditional village government in Samoa presents significant barriers that limit women’s access to and participation in decision-making forums in local government councils, church leadership, school management and community-based organisations.  Without significant participation in leadership decision-making at the village level, it is difficult for women to become – or to be seen as – national leaders.

Obstacles to women standing for or being elected to parliament include many cultural factors. Traditional villages have long been organised around separate statuses and roles of men and women in which executive authority is vested in men. 

Since the 1960s, increasing numbers of women have become matai, often in recognition of their educational and career achievements; however of all village-based matai, only about 5% are women and 19 villages do not recognise women matai on the grounds of tradition.  This is an impediment to women wishing to stand for parliamentary elections because village councils are highly influential in elections.  The most common obstacle to women’s voice in local government is that very few women matai sit in the village councils.  This is an unspoken norm, often justified by the customary concept of ‘o le va tapuia’ (sacred space).

Whilst much of Samoa’s social stability rests on the continued effectiveness of village concils and churches in village government, the exclusion or marginalisation of women’s voices in the governing of Samoa’s villages and at national level is likely to be counterproductive in relation to some of Samoa’s development issues.""" ;

The percentage of households headed by women is still used as a proxy indicator of the feminisation of poverty.

    :description """The case studies of coalitions in Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea and Tonga highlight four influential factors in the formation and functioning of coalitions:  
Formative events:  What brought people together to ‘do something’ in a concerted way? For example, the torture and death of a woman in a sorcery-related violence incident generated the impetus for the formation of the Papua New Guinea coalition examined in this study. Whether formative events are locally or externally driven appears to mould the future shape of a coalition and how it functions. 
Shared purpose, interests and values: Clarity of shared ground and common purpose helps coalitions increase their support base, coherence and influence. The dominant forms of common purpose identified by this study are shared values and interests. For example, the Fiji case study illustrates how shared values around universal human rights and a common purpose of fighting a constitutional amendment bound together a broad range of actors to challenge gender relations. 
Forms of leadership: The nature of a coalition’s leadership can determine its sustainability and its ability to respond to changing circumstances, broker relationships and divergent interests, and challenge vested interests.  Some coalitions understood and practised leadership as a process of adaptation; others understood leadership to be a characteristic of leaders.  For example, the Tonga case study revealed efforts to divest and decentralise leadership to overcome the limitations of individual leadership. 
The nature of ownership: The degree to which a coalition’s agenda is locally owned and its ways of working are politically salient appears to be key to determining its effectiveness. This study found that the coalitions examined could be broadly characterised as local/hybrid variations. For example, the Kiribati coalition formed following a regional meeting and was initially supported by international donors. However, it quickly became ‘localised’ because its coordinator and members were I-Kiribati and they set its agenda and direction. 
The report also discusses how the coalitions engage with different dimensions of power, and emerging lessons for coalitions and their supporters.""" ;

The tensions created in the overlap between the ideal of non-violent men who are secure in themselves and their circumstances, and men’s experiences of insecurity and violence, can undermine the wider mission of gender equality and obfuscate the complexities of social and intimate relationships where violence occurs.

    :description """The review finds that there are very strong outcomes for Spa Academy scholarship graduates and their families. 

Graduates feel more confident and valuable. Graduates have increased decision-making power in their families and communities and are considered more of a leader since graduating particularly at work as well as in their families and communities. Graduates have become more empowered and independent. 

Graduates have improved their material conditions. They are able to find employment based on their increased skills and knowledge and their nationally or internationally recognised qualification. Almost all graduates now have a career in the tourism industry. They have increased their income and many graduates have increased their assets (an increase in a graduate’s assets is usually correlated with a longer time since graduation). Graduates are using their increased income to improve their own situations as well as the situations of their families. Almost all graduates have their own bank accounts and control over these accounts. 

Changes in the lives of the graduates is having a largely positive effect on their families and there is some evidence of effects in their communities. Most family members have changed what they think men and women can do through witnessing the process of the scholarship recipients complete their study and begin working. This change in thinking has not fully translated into practice, however. For example, most women are working more since graduating. They now have paid employment and are still undertaking most of the care work in the house. In some households, women and men have renegotiated this workload. This is an example of joint decision making that is occurring in most households. 

Within the community, women are serving as role models and have contributed to an improved view of women. This change of community attitude is not complete, however, with women still facing discriminative attitudes in general and negative attitudes about working in the spa industry specifically. 

The scholarships have contributed to two formal changes to systems: the beginning of a collective association, through the Fiji Section of the international beauty association International Committee of Aesthetics and Cosmetology (CIDESCO), which will advocate for consistent pay rates across the sector; and the implementation of sexual harassment policy in spas and hotels across Fiji.""" ;

    :description """This review found that UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme is aligned with Pacific country commitments to upholding children’s rights, and its approaches largely target regional priorities, structures and gaps.  Specific findings included: 

- There is a need to better contextualise child protection system strengthening approaches to national and local circumstances, and to sharpen messages so that the goals are explicitly communicated and the intended impact is more in focus.  

- Strengthening relationships and collaborating with national and regional actors working to end violence against women and improve Pacific justice systems could help to strengthen child protection systems. 

- A tailored national framework to track child protection system strengthening progress, and other relevant tools, would improve child protection coordination. 

- There is limited evidence that the programme’s community mobilisation and behaviour change approaches and tools strengthened skills, knowledge and behaviours, or was effective in developing child protection systems. 

- Advocacy for child protection systems building has been less influential in raising the visibility and gravity of all forms of violence against children, and in highlighting the link between child protection system building and prevention of and response to violence, abuse and exploitation of children. 

- Collaboration on child protection work has been uneven, and increased coordination and learning with multi-stakeholder partners, including those working to end violence against women and other protection systems, is needed. 

- The limited number of national child protection policies or plans contributed to a fragmented, project-oriented programme in most countries. 

- Funds and expertise could have been better used to achieve results through assessing and prioritising partners’ readiness for funding support, and by identifying more realistic technical and institutional requirements. 

- The child protection systems building approach is conducive to achieving sustainable outcomes, but increased attention to appropriate institutional arrangements, planning and budgeting processes is needed to help strengthen and protect programme investments. 

- Mainstreaming child protection in various national and community based protection system interventions and referral pathways, and deepening alliances with other networks, such as those working on eliminating violence against women and girls, has been limited, but are important strategies for sustainability in the Pacific context. 

- In most countries, child protection system strengthening is highly dependent on UNICEF funding.""" ;

This regional report articulates a framework for action that is relevant for all actors working to address violence against women across the region; and identifies ‘promising practices’ that could guide efforts to scale up efforts to address violence against women.  

Promising practices include the support to organisations including the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre, Vanuatu Women’s Centre, Family and Sexual Violence Action Committee in Papua New Guinea and the Association of Men Against Violence in Timor-Leste. 

The report finds that there is no doubt that much progress has been made in the last 15 years in addressing violence against women. Thanks largely to the efforts of women’s rights activists, all partner governments have made a public commitment to ending violence against women. 

However, there remains an enormous gap between public discourse and reality. International donors have made important contributions to ongoing efforts, but support is poorly coordinated – between donors, and even among programs within the same agencies. 

To maximise the impact of development assistance, it is crucial to develop broad strategies involving a greatly increased and sustained contribution of financial resources, but also a commitment to discuss gender equality and violence against women in high level, policy dialogue with partner governments.""" ;

The purpose of this brief is to draw the attention of Pacific delegates attending the Rio +20 conference to the importance of gender equality and to ensure contributions to the global sustainable development agenda and negotiations take into consideration gender equality commitments made at the regional and international levels. It is recommended the gender specific information contained in this brief be used by representatives of member countries in their own national statements, country interventions and in various other high-level meetings running in parallel with the Rio +20 Summit. 

Key messages in the brief are: 

- Increasing poverty is increasing women’s burden. 

- Women’s economic empowerment is one of the critical areas of the Pacific Platform for Action on Gender Equality and the Advancement of Women. 

- Gender-blind macroeconomic policies may have adverse effects on women and increase gender inequalities. 

- The development of a green economy that will benefit both women and men requires gender-responsive economic policies and programmes. 

- Promoting gender equality through education will prepare the younger generation to address the emerging issues that Pacific Islands face. 

- The well-being of Pacific Island people requires the development of an enabling environment for women’s rights to health care services and for their reproductive and sexual rights. 

- Gender-based violence has tremendous individual, social and economic costs. 

- Depletion of natural resources and environmental stresses do not have the same impacts on women and men. 

- Women’s role as farmers and in fisheries is often overlooked. 

- Women’s participation in policy making and design of training and services in relation to land use are fundamental for adapting to environmental stresses and climate change. 

- Developing sustainable sources of energy to address the needs of both women and men is critical for sustaining the development of Pacific Island countries and territories. 

- Numerous international and regional platforms and conventions state the importance of gender equality for achieving development, peace, prosperity and resilience. 

- The Pacific Island region is still struggling to meet the commitments towards gender equality and improve women’s human rights. 

- The Pacific Platform for Action on the Advancement of Women and Gender Equality is a key instrument in the promotion of gender equality for sustainable development in the Pacific Islands region. 

- Delegations from Pacific Island countries and territories can play a significant role in putting forward gender equality and women’s human rights during Rio +20 negotiations.""" ;

Salamasina - Tausala o Samoa was initiated and established in January 2012 as part of the Emerging Pacific Womens Leadership Programme. The contribution of women in the socio-economic sector in Samoa has been remarkable. However, ad hoc evidence indicates that women are under-represented in the political sphere and in boardrooms. At the grass root level, the challenge is much larger and more concerning as more than 76 percent of Samoan domestic sector workers are women.  These women lack the necessary skills to tap into the employment opportunities available with the growth in the tourism industry and thus most are unpaid, under-paid or under-employed. In addition, these employment opportunities are increasingly being taken up by Fijians, Filipinos and others filling the skills deficit currently in the labour market. 

Notwithstanding these realities there are multi-faceted issues regarding the Sector’s lack of protection of workers well-being and natural rights and lack of recognition under current labour legislation. 

The focus of the Salamasina - Tausala o Samoa programme was to address challenges faced by unemployed and vulnerable women at the grass roots level so that they attain self-sufficiency and financial independence.

- The acceptability of violence against women – the majority of women (73%) in Solomon Islands believe that a man is justified in beating his wife under some circumstances (in particular, for infidelity and disobedience). 

- The frequent use of physical punishment to discipline women who are seen as transgressing their prescribed gender roles. 

- The common practice of physically disciplining children, which means that children learn from a young age that physical violence is normal (cycle of violence).

This blurring of the two occurs not only in popular accounts in the media but is widely reproduced by NGOs, donor organisations, and government institutions. A new acronym has even been coined SRK (‘sorcery-related killing’) that perpetuates the definitional lack of clarity, since it uses one term, sorcery, to refer to both sorcery and witchcraft. Some of the confusion in understanding is compounded by the range of terms used ‘poison,’ ‘sangguma,’ ‘puripuri,’ ‘blak pawa,’ and ‘wiskrap’. Some of these are derived from various places in Papua New Guinea, and some from English. The meanings these borrowed words carry in their original context are often lost in the new context. 

Sorcery involves the purposeful actions of a person who intends to cause misfortune or harm to others (or to benefit them), and who sets about doing this through ritual means or incantations. In Papua New Guinea, a large range of techniques exist for this and these can be passed down the generations, acquired from relatives or friends, or simply purchased for cash. For those who believe in the efficacy of sorcery in Papua New Guinea, it is a set of practices that can be learnt and is something a person sets out to do. 

Witchcraft, on the other hand, does not comprise a set of practices that can be learnt. Rather, it is believed to be a form of possession by the ‘witch substance’ or creature, which resides in the body (abdomen, chest, scrotum, vagina, womb, head, armpit, etc.) and takes control of the possessed person.""" ;

    :description """The Sorcery Act criminalised the use of sorcery for ‘evil purposes’. It was repealed in 2013 in the wake of several high profile and gruesome killings related to sorcery accusations, because of a widespread perception that the Act could make available a defence in cases involving violence toward suspected sorcerers. In addition to repealing the Act, Prime Minister Peter O’Neill introduced a penal measure extending the death penalty to sorcery-related murders. 

However timely the repeal of the Act may have been, in practical terms this event was largely symbolic. Cases involving sorcery infrequently make it to the national courts, where the repeal of this piece of legislation might actually constrain the options available to defendants who claim to have been provoked by the actions of sorcerers. 

The majority of sorcery cases, instead, are heard in village courts, particularly those in remote rural areas where concerns about sorcery are strongest, and are often a matter of nearly daily discussion.

This short paper assets that further information is needed from the village courts about how they can best be supported in dealing with sorcery cases. Greater support, in terms of both resourcing and adjudication guidance, could go some way towards closing the gap perceived by many rural people between their concerns and those of elites in the capital, Port Moresby.""" ;

    :description """Every day, 20,000 girls below age 18 give birth in developing countries. Births to girls also occur in developed countries but on a much smaller scale. Most of the world’s births to adolescents— 95 per cent—occur in developing countries, and nine in 10 of these births occur within marriage or a union. About 19 per cent of young women in developing countries become pregnant before age 18. Girls under 15 account for 2 million of the 7.3 million births that occur to adolescent girls under 18 every year in developing countries. 

A pregnancy can have immediate and lasting consequences for a girl’s health, education and income-earning potential. And it often alters the course of her entire life. How it alters her life depends in part on how old—or young—she is. 

Underlying causes of adolescent pregnancy are: 

- Child marriage. 

- Gender inequality. 

- Obstacles to human rights. 

- Poverty. 

- Sexual violence and coercion. 

- National policies restricting access to contraception, age-appropriate sexuality education. 

- Lack of access to education and reproductive health services. 

- Underinvestment in adolescent girls’ human capital. 

Many countries have taken up the cause of preventing adolescent pregnancies, often through actions aimed at changing a girl’s behaviour. Implicit in such interventions are a belief that the girl is responsible for preventing pregnancy and an assumption that if she does become pregnant, she is at fault. Such approaches and thinking are misguided because they fail to account for the circumstances and societal pressures that conspire against adolescent girls and make motherhood a likely outcome of their transition from childhood to adulthood. 

What is needed is a new way of thinking about the challenge of adolescent pregnancy. Instead of viewing the girl as the problem and changing her behaviour as the solution, governments, communities, families and schools should see poverty, gender inequality, discrimination, lack of access to services, and negative views about girls and women as the real challenges, and the pursuit of social justice, equitable development and the empowerment of girls as the true pathway to fewer adolescent pregnancies.""" ;

- There is overwhelming evidence that the studies in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati were generally been carried out appropriately and effectively. 

- There is an overriding sense of achievement, all field workers came back safely and intact, a phenomenal job was done and an enormous amount of data was collected with high response rates and disclosure rates. 

- Respondents generally felt satisfied, relieved and valued for having been able to share their stories. 

- There were many issues and challenges and that lessons have been learned that should be taken into consideration for future work. 

- Success is largely thanks to the regional and country research teams who had effectively mobilised stakeholders and achieved buy-in from many levels, and (when they realised they did not have all the technical and gender background in the team) knew how to tap expert support all along the process of the project. 

- Important contributions were made by a number of technical advisors, representatives from donors, and expert consultants throughout the process. 

- Entering unknown territory and using approaches for surveys on sensitive topics that they had not used before, with due consideration for ethics and safety, the teams managed to bring the research to a good end. They successfully accessed, involved and used mentors and technical experts for moral and technical support, to develop structures and links and maintained relationships and were able to learn by doing.

- The researchers and fieldworkers developed an increased understanding and commitment to work on reducing violence against women. • The project can serve as a best practice model for researching violence against women as a data collection activity and as a participatory approach with capacity and awareness building.""" ;

Limited, unregulated and inaccessible childcare options for children aged zero to five result in absenteeism, lateness, low productivity, distraction, exhaustion and stress for working parents.

The study  demonstrates that childcare responsibilities are having significant impacts on mothers and fathers and their ability to consistently perform at work and focus on their job. The challenge of working and raising children in Fiji affects the choices they make about: the type of work they do; the career goals they aspire to achieve; the hours they work; and whether they stay in the workforce at all. This poses a key constraint on women’s participation and re-entry into the workforce in particular, which is already a challenge in Fiji with just 37 percent of women formally employed in Fiji, compared to 72 percent of men.

It is designed to be a reference for judges, magistrates, legal practitioners, law students human rights advocates, civil society representatives and policy makers across the Pacific.  

It contains the text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and its two international covenants: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Collectively, these three international human rights documents have been commonly referred to as the International Bill of Rights (IBOR). It also contains seven other United Nations international human rights treaties. These treaties have the force of international law for the states that ratify or accede to them. Each of these treaties establishes a treaty body responsible for monitoring implementation by state parties. Some of the treaties are supplemented by optional protocols that deal with specific concerns or individual complaint mechanisms an the optional protocols are included in this compilation. Every Pacific Island country is a party to at least one of these treaties, thereby agreeing to the universally accepted principles of human rights that apply to every woman, man and child. These treaties are at the core of the international system for the promotion and protection of human rights. Significantly, these international human rights standards have had an impact at the regional and national level, forming the basis of bills of rights in the constitutions of many Pacific Island countries. They have also inspired instances of legislative reform, as well as national policy, and have been used as reference points for the formulation of guiding principles at the judicial level. The publication also contains titles and web links to other human rights documents. This part of the publication seeks to facilitate access for readers to other international human rights instruments, documents and declarations that have regional significance.

This has serious negative impacts on individuals, families, communities and workplaces. For the three companies included in this study, the high rates of domestic and sexual violence translate into lost staff time and reduced productivity that is equivalent to almost 10 days of lost work per employee each year.

This study includes three private sector companies, collectively employing 1,701 employees as of December 2018. The companies were selected to ensure sector diversity and based on their commitment to supporting staff affected by domestic and sexual violence. A total of 563 staff completed the staff survey, representing 33 per cent of all employees. The study also included individual and group interviews involving 43 women and 43 men in both supervisory and non-supervisory roles.""" ;

1. Global Fund grantmaking contributed to impact at three levels: on the individual lives of over half a million women and girls, their families and communities, on the sustainability and capacities of the grantee organisations and networks, and through concrete political and economic gains for gender equality. 
2. Global Fund grantmaking strategy is responsible for the results. Global Fund strategy achieved results by: a) identifying grantee partners that implement a rights-based approach, b) building a portfolio that collectively advances transformative change, and c) by mobilising high-quality resources for that portfolio. 
3. The networked activism of women’s rights movements secures concrete political and economic gains. One win over the past twenty years is the emergence of a global agenda for gender equality. However, goals alone do not achieve results. Women’s rights movements work for systemic change in a variety of ways, including advocacy, that create the political will necessary for goals to result in measurable change. 
4. Work for women and girls’ rights is an underfunded strategy. Despite playing a critical role in social, political, and economic development, the work of girls’ and women’s rights organisations, networks and movements are drastically underfunded, making up less than 10% of philanthropic giving in both Europe and the United States. 
5. Rights-based approaches to change yield higher impact outcomes. During the independent evaluation, a rubric was developed to measure implementation of a ‘human rights-based approach at the organisational level. Grantees that scored higher on this rubric at the outset were more likely to report significant achievements for gender equality by the close of the project.""" ;

- Many adolescent girls in Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea lack comprehensive knowledge about menstruation and are unprepared for menarche. In Fiji, they have reasonably good access to education and information.

- Reputable sanitary products are available in urban areas in Fiji and Papua New Guinea; but less available in rural areas. In Fiji and Papua New Guinea, products were affordable for those with an income. In Solomon Islands, they are prohibitively priced and much less available.

- Girls and women with less access to money may rely on home-made solutions (of variable efficacy) to manage menstruation.

- Women and girls commonly experience fear of leakage and staining, and are subsequently distracted from school or work. Some opt to disengage with community life, stay home from school, or miss work on days of heavy bleeding.

- In Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, WASH facilities in schools and workplaces are commonly inadequate to meet the needs of menstruating girls and women.

    :description """The Bougainville Do No Harm research confirms that women do not always gain greater empowerment when they bring money into the household because their access to economic resources does not automatically give them control over those resources. Neither is violence towards them reduced. Bringing economic resources into the household may in fact heighten tensions over the expenditure of the resources. 

An important implication of the research so far is that the design of women’s economic empowerment programs should avoid minimalist initiatives — that is, aiming simply to give women access to economic opportunities without any focus on gender and gender relations, especially the role of gender norms and practices in the context of marital relationships. Addressing women’s economic opportunities in isolation from other dimensions of their lives, including their household — where bargaining over resources takes place — can limit the overall gains possible for women. For example, a woman might be considered empowered economically, if she has (1) the ability to make decisions or influence decisions on issues of livelihood management (such as children’s education and general expenditure) and (2) she has access to and control over resources (including ownership of land and property, an equal role in managing and keeping family cash, her own independent income and control of her savings income). But the same woman may be disempowered in a number of other areas pertaining to the absence of certain personal freedoms (being subject to violence, freedom of movement, freedom to choose who to vote for, and freedom to use family planning). These limitations may be imposed not only by husbands but by social gender norms. 

Achieving women’s economic empowerment is contingent not only on having access to economic resources but also the removal of impediments to their freedom which disempower them in other ways.""" ;

- Fiji is the highest ranked Pacific country (81 out of 128 ranked countries). 

- Solomon Islands (125/128) and Papua New Guinea (126/128) are in the bottom  five, ranked lower than all Sub-Saharan African countries except Sudan.

- One of the key findings is that while the six Pacific countries are categorised as Low Middle Income, when it comes to women’s economic opportunity they track similarly to Low Income Countries (with the exception of Fiji, which nevertheless performs below the global average in every category and on most indicators.) 

- Pacific countries perform well on some indicators, primarily Citizenship Rights which includes freedom of social participation and movement, and education; PNG, however, ranks second worst in the world on education with the average woman able to expect only 5.2 years of formal education. 

-  Of relevance to development programs and policies are the indicators where the Pacific scores particularly badly: 
- Property ownership / equal legal ownership rights: customary law doesn’t take precedence over statutory law (Pacific Island countries are the lowest group of countries in the world). 
- Equal pay, non-discrimination and legal protection in the workplace: enforcing of an equal pay policy.  
- Access to finance: includes outreach programmes, financial services and financial literacy. 
- Political participation: Share of women in ministerial positions, parliament and public office. 
- Levels of violence against women: laws that protect women from domestic violence, rape, physical attacks and sexual harassment (these are not indicators of the incidence of violence against women). 
- Tertiary education: total number of years a woman could expect in tertiary education. 
- Maternity and paternity entitlements: leave and provision. 
- Infrastructure risk: risk that deficiencies will cause loss of income and business (Samoa and Fiji are exceptions).""" ;

This Thematic Brief provides information and analysis about equality for people with diverse SOGIESC in the Pacific Islands region, also referencing the Pacific’s involvement in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for which a key pillar is to “leave no one behind.” The SDGs recognise that to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development there is a need to address all people in society including marginalized groups and vulnerable populations, such as LGBTI people who may be discriminated based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC).
The brief has been written for the Support Unit of Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development (Pacific Women). The five key messages provide background to inclusion issues for people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) in the Pacific.
The Thematic Brief sets out why Pacific Women is supporting people with diverse SOGIESC and women in all their diversity to enjoy their human rights and fully participate in their communities.
1. People with diverse SOGIESC experience violence, harassment, discrimination, social stigma and poverty.
2. Law reform is needed to end discrimination and criminalisation of people with diverse SOGIESC and to enable them to live free from discrimination and violence.
3. Pacific Island countries have long had populations with diverse SOGIESC; in some countries people with diverse SOGIESC have specific cultural roles.
4. People with diverse SOGIESC are particularly vulnerable during periods of disasters and emergencies including the COVID-19 pandemic.

The seven key messages about violence against women and girls in the Pacific region, and the work supported by Pacific Women, follow. These messages also apply during the COVID-19 response period. During a crisis, women and girls are at increased risk of men’s physical and sexual violence as result of existing gender inequalities being magnified, with women having considerably less autonomy and mobility leading to increases in men’s violence against women.
1. Women in the Pacific face some of the highest levels of violence in the world. An estimated 60 per cent of women and girls have experienced violence by an intimate partner or family member.
2. Women and girls are at increased risk of men’s physical and sexual violence during a crisis, such as natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. Violence takes many forms and women often experience multiple types of violence.
4. Violence affects women first and foremost but also their children, families and communities.
5. Physical and sexual violence limits women’s economic empowerment and has high economic costs for societies, including lost wages and productivity, health care and the criminal justice costs of apprehending, prosecuting and imprisoning perpetrators.
6. The Pacific is developing a stronger legislative framework to protect women, but action is needed to implement these laws.

3. Women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to physical violence, rape and sexual abuse, with perpetrators rarely brought to justice.
4. Women with disabilities are skilled, capable and able to make decisions for themselves and care for their families, and to share equal rights with people without disabilities. They are parents, community members, workers and leaders.
5. Participation is central to effective disability inclusion and ensuring women and girls with disabilities participate in decisions that relate to them and reflect their aspirations, abilities and contributions.

    :description """This Thematic Brief provides information and analysis about leadership and decision making for women and girls in the Pacific Islands region.
In the 2012 Pacific Leaders’ Gender Equality Declaration, Pacific leaders committed to implementing the following gender-responsive government programs and policies to promote women’s roles in leadership and decision making:
▪ Adopt measures, including temporary special measures (such as legislation to establish reserved seats for women and political party reforms), to accelerate women’s full and equal participation in governance reform at all levels and women’s leadership in all decision making.
▪ Advocate for increased representation of women in private sector and local level governance boards and committees (such as school boards and produce market committees).
The following five key messages help explain the importance of working to increase women’s participation in leadership and decision making, and why Pacific Women supports such initiatives. These messages are premised on a commitment to eliminate discriminatory social norms through generational change and the development of enabling environments that support women to be decision makers at all levels, including in families, communities, places of employment, business and local and national government.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need for women’s and girls’ participation, leadership and decision making in all aspects of response planning and implementation. Women’s participation and leadership is essential for an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for mobilising communities and health communications.
1. The Pacific region has the lowest level of women’s political participation globally.
2. Temporary special measures have been introduced in the region to increase women’s representation at the national and sub-national levels.
3. Working in Pacific Island countries requires an adaptive approach, to support a fair and better balance in women’s and men’s leadership roles and opportunities.
4. Supporting women’s participation in all levels of decision making is key to reducing poverty, promoting the quality of economic growth, democracy, and increasing wellbeing of women, girls and their families.
5. Supporting women’s leadership and decision making must occur at all levels. Just focusing on political representation at the national level is not enough.""" ;

Following are the underlying issues relating to seven common myths about gender equality in the Pacific, and why Pacific Women is working to change harmful social norms and practices. These myths often proliferate during a crisis, such as a natural disaster or the COVID-19 pandemic.
1. Gender equality is a Western concept and has no place within Pacific culture.
2. Pacific women have high social standing through their traditional social and cultural roles and they do not
want or need access to mainstream economic and leadership opportunities.
3. Religious teachings justify gender inequality.
4. Women and girls are more at risk of sexual violence from strangers than from people they know.
5. Violence in the home is a private issue.

3. Women are more exposed and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

The following five key messages help explain underlying issues about women, peace and security and why Pacific Women is supporting this work. This includes a need for formal recognition of women’s role in conflict prevention and recovery plus humanitarian crisis response, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic response. These messages reflect the United Nations Security Council endorsed resolution 1325 on women, peace and security in October 2000. The resolution drew on lessons learned on peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Resolution 1325 calls on countries to address the impacts that conflict had on women and girls and advocates for women’s participation in peace and security processes as a critical step towards conflict-resolution.4 The women, peace and security agenda rests on four pillars: prevention, participation, protection, and relief and recovery.
The five key messages are:
1. The skills of women as mediators and decision makers need to be recognised and included in peace negotiations.
2. Women are often the most affected by conflict violence and increasing securitisation. The presence of armed forces has increased through national COVID-19 responses.
3. Women are already active in conflict prevention, post-conflict recovery efforts and humanitarian crisis response, such as COVID-19, and this needs to be formally recognised and supported.
4. The gendered approach to security sector governance needs to be enhanced.

The following five key messages provide background to women’s economic empowerment issues in the Pacific and explain why Pacific Women is supporting women to become more empowered and active at all levels of the economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, women’s economic empowerment is a critical issue for effective response and recovery.
Women’s economic empowerment is central to realising women’s rights and gender equality. Economic empowerment encompasses a wide array of processes, platforms and actors. Economically empowered women have access to and control over resources, enabled by a supportive social and political environment. This includes women’s equal opportunity with men to have control over income and assets, access to decent work, social protection, control over time and equal participation in economic decisions from the household to international levels.
1. There is a significant and persistent gap between men’s and women’s economic opportunities, security and income.
2. Women’s empowerment and economic participation is central to sustainable development and sustained poverty reduction.
3. Improving women’s economic opportunity requires changes in economic and social policies and laws to support women’s equitable participation in existing markets.

    :description """This annual report notes that the eyes of the world were focused on Samoa and the wider region for the Small Islands Developing States Conference and UN Women’s Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo Nguka’s first visit to the Pacific. 
Highlights from the year included: 

- The launch of UN Women’s Markets for Change project. 

- A highly visible 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence campaign. 

- Clear progress for women’s political participation with Fiji’s first democratic election since 2006 resulting in the highest percentage of women representatives ever elected in the Pacific. 

- Elections in Tonga and Solomon Islands saw a significant increase in women candidates running, as well as the number of votes received. 

- Dame Meg Taylor’s appointment as Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat was the first time a women has been elected to head of a regional body in the Pacific. 

- Four new countries adopted ending violence against women legislation for the first time in 2014. 

2014 saw UN Women’s programmes in the Pacific reach more women than ever before. There is evidence of progress and that the needs, potential and contributions of Pacific women are being prioritised and included in the private and public sectors alike. There is still, however, much to be done. The ongoing global discussions and negotiations that will determine the shape of the new development framework to replace the Millennium Development Goals make this a critical time for gender equality and women’s empowerment in the Pacific region.""" ;

    :description """This paper supports the case for a transformative goal on gender equality, women’s rights and women’s empowerment. The case for a stand-alone gender-related goal, as well as addressing gender priorities into each goal, has been actively supported by Pacific Leaders and the women’s movement. The importance of a standalone goal in post-2015 development agenda was evident at the 12th Triennial Conference of Pacific Women held 2013. A key recommendation from the Triennial Conference was that; ‘the post 2015 development agenda to adopt a transformative stand-alone goal to achieve gender equality, women’s rights and women’s empowerment, structured around several target areas: freedom from violence, gender equality in capabilities and resources, gender equality and decision making power, and a voice in public and private institutions’. 

This document sets out the stand-alone goal to achieve gender equality, women’s rights and women’s empowerment proposed by UN Women and structured around three global target areas: 

- Freedom from violence. 

- Gender equality in capabilities and resources. 

- Gender equality in decision-making power and voice in public and private institutions. 

These three areas address inter-related dimensions of gender inequality. 

Global indicators that are designed to measure progress towards transformative change in gender relations are useful to monitor a stand-alone goal and the gender considerations in other goals.""" ;

It is a unique case-study that captures the specific menstrual health challenges faced by countries with dispersed populations across large geographic locations with limited income and commercial access. The report explores how innovative investment can be a means of facilitating a new market opportunity, enabling improved access to necessary healthcare products, and support venture creation for women-led businesses. 

The report contains findings at the enterprise level and at the menstrual health ecosystem level. It details opportunities for actions in 

- Ecosystem-level coordination and investment. 

- Aggregate imports of materials. 

- Aggregate business models to seek investment.

These three opportunities outlined above and identified through the workshop each demonstrate the value of the menstrual health market to women and girls, to the local community and economy, and investors who want to use their capital to create meaningful impact. They show how actors in the Pacific can work both at the enterprise and menstrual health ecosystem levels to create a sustainable market and attend to the menstrual health needs of women and girls in the region.""" ;

- Violence by husbands/partners occurs in all provinces and islands, and among all age groups, education levels, socio-economic groups and religions. 

- 50 % of women believe that a good wife must obey her husband even if she disagrees with him. 

- 40% of women believe that the man should be the boss. 

- 53 % of women believe that a woman becomes a man’s property after bride price is paid and 36% of women agree that it is all right for a woman or girl to be swapped or exchanged for marriage. 

- 60% of women agree with at least 1 justification for a man to beat his wife: 34% believe that violence is justified if a wife is disobedient to her husband; 28% think it is all right for him to beat her to discipline her or teach her a lesson; and 32% believe that a man is justified in beating his wife if bride price has been paid. 

- Between 12% and 23% do not think they have the right to refuse sex in some situations, and 40% of women are unclear if they have the right to refuse sex if bride price has been paid. 

- 48% of women had experienced non-partner physical or sexual violence or both since they turned 15. Most non-partner physical abuse was by male family members. Most of the non-partner sexual abuse was by boyfriends or male family members. 

- The prevalence of sexual abuse against girls under the age of 15 is also one of the very highest in the world. Almost 30% of women were sexually abused before the age of 15 years. 

- For 28% of women, their first sexual experience was forced. 

- 24% of women have been injured in their lifetime due to violence from a partner. 

- 15% of all women who have ever been pregnant have been hit during the pregnancy, and 9% have been hit or kicked in the stomach. 

The situations most commonly mentioned by women as triggers for violence are directly related to unequal gender power relations. Women reported that their partners hit them: 

- For no reason (30%). 

- Because they were disobedient or to discipline them (23%). 

- For refusing sex (15%). • Because there was no food at home (20%).""" ;

    :description """The Voter Education Project was targeted at the ‘lost generation’ of Bougainville (people aged 35 to 45 years). Over 20 months, the Bougainville Women’s Federation and International Women’s Development Agency provided education about voting rights and responsibilities to 22,463 women and female youth, including 206 with disabilities and 21,368 men and male youth, including 383 with disabilities and another 53 people with disabilities. These voters were able to use these skills in the 2017 Papua New Guinea national elections. 

Whilst the project targeted both women and men, it paid particular attention to engaging women. This is because the experiences of post-conflict trauma and disadvantage suffered by this particular group intersects with more generalised patterns of women’s disenfranchisement from democratic processes in Bougainville and across the Pacific. 

Using a community trainer model, the project provided on-the-ground education about voting, elections and making informed decisions as a voter in over 740 communities. Women were seen by communities in leadership roles, as 22 of the 43 community trainers were women. The voter education workshops included mock elections, which many participants viewed as the highlight. The use of local languages, good governance DVDs and mock elections were critical in distilling complex processes into accessible information. 

The project’s monitoring data, observations from election observers and the election results all indicated that the voter education workshops increased voters’ confidence in understanding the Limited Preferential Voting system, casting their votes correctly, and understanding their right to freely choose their preferred candidate. Reports from election observers evidenced that women were well represented in the ballot boxes. Women reported confidently casting their votes based on their own decisions, rather than as a result of influence or coercion from male family members.""" ;

    :description """The issue of sorcery and witchcraft-related accusations and violence in Papua New Guinea is receiving increasing attention domestically and internationally. A growing body of literature is also focusing on the issue, providing non-government organisations, donor agencies, and the Papua New Guinea government with an evidence base for addressing the problem in locally appropriate ways. Little of the literature, however, deliberates upon the perpetrators of these violent attacks. This is a serious shortcoming, since if culturally appropriate and meaningful prevention strategies are to be developed, there is a need to understand the worldview of the perpetrators and the factors propelling their violent, often repeated, attacks. 

This short paper shares the reflections of perpetrators of sorcery accusation-related violence, presenting their perspectives on why they have killed people accused of witchcraft.  Accusations, and the violence that follows, occur when someone is seriously ill or dies. Witch-hunts are referred to as ‘operations’ and are justified by taking the view that ‘rubbish’ (pipia), ‘weeds’ (gras no gut), or ‘dangerous snakes’ (snek no gut) must be removed from the community. In all of the cases studied, the community sanctioned the violence and killing of the person accused of being a witch. 

The research suggests that there is a need for a primary prevention approach — to address the violence before it takes place. This would entail working more closely with communities and, importantly, the perpetrators, because violent actions against accused witches are generally widely supported. Potential perpetrators in the community not only will begin to hear wider views as the issue is discussed, but may also realise that they cannot rely on community support.""" ;

    :description """This short paper identifies four central insights from a legal positive perspective into killings related to sorcery and witchcraft accusations: 

- The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is a significant cause of fear and insecurity in Melanesia, as most deaths, sickness and other misfortunes are attributed to the malevolent powers of sorcerers and witches, meaning that people are always on guard against such attacks. 

- There are two very different groups of victims in this area, but they are often not clearly distinguished, resulting in considerable potential for talking at cross-purposes. The first group of victims are those people who are believed to have been killed or made sick or otherwise negatively affected by the actions of a witch or a sorcerer. The second group of victims are those who are accused of being witches or sorcerers and are consequently attacked or expelled from their community. 

- The current state legal responses to the violence and conflict associated with sorcery and witchcraft-related beliefs and practices in Melanesia are ineffectual. 

- Simplistic solutions such as repealing legislation and imposing draconian sentences will not help, and may even make matters worse. What is required instead is a multi-stranded, pluralist approach that engages state, local and church responses creatively and strategically.""" ;

The decision that political representation was an accurate data base to measure the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women is examined in detail, with specific country cases demonstrating that figures do not reflect this as an accurate measure. The reality for women who run for office in male environments is exposed, and questions are asked about the ethics of seeing this as the only outcome for evaluation.

    :description """This short paper looks at the example of women parliamentarians in Kiribati and Samoa to identify common characteristics of women who have been successful at being elected: 

- Coming from a large and influential family provides an important ‘base vote’, willing campaign helpers, and potential financiers. Women MPs also tend to come from political families. That is, one or both of their parents, uncles or brothers have tended to have been in politics and they often act as patrons and mentors. 

- Women MPs tend to have above-average levels of education — usually from overseas. 

- The most common pre-political background for Pacific MPs has been the public service. 

- Along with a profile, having a good reputation is important for any prospective candidate in the Pacific. There are all manner of community events — weddings, funerals, birthdays etc. — that could be included here, but most of these revolve around church activities. Many MPs, including women, hold leadership positions with local churches and derive a reputation for community involvement. 

- Two in particular campaign strategies stand out for women: First, or those with a large national profile and significant financial resources, involvement in day-to-day community events is often unnecessary as they largely win on the basis of being well known. Secondly, most women MPs in the Pacific tend to form part of a group of waged elites who retain connections with their constituency while working away in the capital and who return and contest on the strength of that reputation. This requires years of hard work, but those who do not put in the time and effort are unlikely to succeed. 

- One common entry point for women MPs is via by-elections where their husband, brother, father or uncle passes away, leaving their seat vacant.""" ;

Highlights of the Policy Brief include: 

- Commemorating the first decade of advancing femLINKpacific’s mission to provide a safe space via community radio and enabling women from within their local communities to claim and localise UNSCR1325 as well as CEDAW with the theme ‘Communicating Peace, Development, Diversity, Security and Freedom’. 

- FemLINKpacific’s Radio with Pictures campaign enabled 82 women leaders in all their diversities, representing a collective constituency of 1811 members, in Nadi, Nausori and Labasa to communicate their peace, human security and development priorities. Through femLINKpacific’s rural network activities 94 women, particularly rural women, disabled women, young women and transgender women came together to discuss and document their collective priorities in Labasa, Nausori, Tavua/Rakiraki, Ba and Nadi. 

- Without women’s equal access to and participation in development processes from the district and tikina level, gender inclusive development will not happen and we will continue to hear the call for improvements in rural infrastructure (roads, water and electricity supply) and enhancing health services as well as guaranteeing a life free of violence and crime. 

- 41% of respondents (143 women) in femLINKpacific’s monthly household income and expenditure survey highlighted the struggle to meet cost of living expenses such as food, household bills, in addition to education, transport and health expenses being priorities when earning less than $50 to at least $200 a week. 

- The survey also highlighted the prevalence of the information-communication and digital divide for 82% of respondents which is why we also celebrate that over the last 10 years we are enabling women who would otherwise be silent or invisible to claim their communication rights.""" ;

For women, the choice to escape violent relationships is constrained by gender norms and social customs such as bride price, custody of children and access to land, which limit their ability to live independently.

    :description """This paper encourages a more targeted focus on women’s economic empowerment through private sector development partnerships, not least through a greater mutual allocation of funds, and design effort. 

The findings suggest that the ECF has contributed both to women’s economic advancement and perhaps to a lesser extent, to women’s power and agency. 

ECF has increased women’s access to employment, training and income, and access to markets, and supported women-owned enterprises to expand their businesses. Specific initiatives that have affected women include: 

- Investing in technology that reduced physical workload. 

- Allowing flexible working conditions. 

- Training women into areas where they are well suited. 

- Improving access to goods and services such as education and financial services targeted at women. 

Women with increased opportunities and income reported that they were more confident and acted as role models to other women and girls. Improved incomes in the household also allowed more income to be invested in improving the livelihood of family members. 

The flow-on development benefits include contributions to the Millennium Development Goals. Although there is a strong donor policy commitment to women’s economic empowerment, a relative lack of public sector funding has been allocated to addressing it.

Design (including monitoring and evaluation) processes need to directly consider women’s economic empowerment, and to draw on the significant and helpful literature readily available on this issue. ECF reporting tends to confirm research demonstrating that consideration of women’s economic empowerment also increases business profit and sustainability. 

Private sector interest has increased in the challenge fund model, demonstrating commercial and social impacts that ECF-funded activities have achieved for employees, suppliers or customers. However, the gap remains between existing research and private sector understanding on gender and commercial impact. 

ECF has seen a growing recognition among grantee businesses of both a strong business and development rationale for supporting women’s economic empowerment in their value chains and local communities. This is encouraging, particularly as the public and private sectors look for opportunities and incentives to work together for poverty alleviation.""" ;

The paper also highlights research gaps, and compares the Pacific experience with broader findings on women’s participation in decision making.

Pacific women’s prominent informal peacebuilding role has not always led to their participation in formal peacebuilding processes: opportunities to facilitate equitable social and political change have been missed. 

Women’s impact on governance and policy-making in the region has received little scrutiny and there is a limited evidence base on this topic. Although gender analyses carried out as part of donor-funded capacity development programs contain a lot of information on women’s participation in Pacific bureaucracies, this material is rarely made public. 

A key finding is that social organisation and gendered cultural beliefs and practices are significant hindrances to women’s
participation in all spheres. Donors wishing to support
women’s empowerment, often through travel to training
and networking events, face challenges in minimising the
potential harm that may arise from such support. When
initiatives to empower individual women move at a faster
pace than institutional and cultural change, enthusiastic
women may return to their work places or communities
to face increased discrimination and, sometimes, physical
violence. This suggests a need to listen to local women’s
views about how empowerment can be achieved – views
that often differ from those of donors.""" ;

    :description """There is growing evidence that at both national and sub-national level, the social capital of urban elites (male and female alike) does not translate into votes at the ballot box. Instead, women who perform well at the polls: 

- Are “of the people”, i.e. either community based or have deep connections to their electorates; 

- Have strong male backers – powerful fathers, brothers, or husbands or, as the 2012 Papua New Guinea elections demonstrated, male supporters who maintain control over polling booths and coordinate the process of 'assisted voting'; 

- Are from high-profile often political families; 

- Have built good reputations as a local representative; 

- Have a solid constituency support base; 

- Have significant involvement in the church; 

- Are serving the community or delivering benefits locally. 
Yet historically, few of the women who contested recent national elections in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu fit this description. 

Typically, a greater proportion of women in each electorate reported experiencing intimidation compared to their male counterparts. Even so a quarter (25%) of male voters (159/626) also reported having experienced intimidation when voting. 

Just as voting experiences are gendered, so too is money politics Men typically receive cash and gifts more often than women and in larger amounts. Nearly two- thirds (64%) of those who elicited cash from candidates during the 2014 Solomon Islands elections were men. In addition, men reported receiving 20% more than women in exchange for their vote, and were far more likely to have personally elicited cash or gifts in return for their votes. They also reported a greater confidence to decline gifts or cash when offered to them, and less bound to honour such commitments.""" ;

Because national politics remains heavily island based, the design of temporary special measures becomes crucial.  Options being considered are:

- Provide an additional seat for women from each of Tuvalu’s eight islands. 

- Add two seats for women to the existing legislature elected from across the entire country. 

- Add two seats for women to the existing legislature but restrict them to Funafuti, the capital.

    :description """The Autonomous Region of Bougainville introduced the Pacific’s first parliamentary reserved seats for women system in 2004. While the system guarantees a minimum level of representation for women in the Bougainville House of Representatives, concerns have been raised that the reserved seats act as a ceiling for women’s representation and prevent women from successfully contesting other seats. No women candidates contested the 33 open seats in the 2005 election. In the 2010 election, five women contested open seats. All the women candidates contesting open seats lost in their constituencies.  

There is a misconception in Bougainville that women are restricted to contesting only the reserved seats. It is unclear how widespread this is, but women’s groups have actively worked to dispel the myth. 

Women who were elected in the reserved seats tended to have adult children, although some had younger families. Educational backgrounds were varied, from grade eight to tertiary educated. They tended to have had careers in the public service, and significant involvement in church, community and women’s organisations. 

A significant factor in successful campaigns was access to resources, such as a candidate owning a personal computer to design and print campaign materials. 

A considerable challenge for both candidates and members of the House of Representatives is the size of the reserved seat electorates, which are significantly larger than the open electorates. To campaign effectively for a reserved seat requires time and significant financial resources. Once elected, regional members are entitled to the same amount of discretionary funds as all other members, despite their electorates being much larger. 

One potential method of increasing consistency would be to hold a ‘mock parliament’ for women. Many women felt a mock legislative session would be beneficial in both building the confidence of possible women candidates, and increasing women’s knowledge of legislative processes.""" ;

- An up-to-date analysis on the situation of young persons with disabilities concerning discrimination and sexual violence, including the impact on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).

- A detailed assessment of legal, policy, and programming developments and specific good practices in service delivery along with best-standard prevention and protection measures. 

- Detailed policy and programming recommendations to assist UNFPA in building a comprehensive programme in this field.

The report sets out the situational context in which young persons with disabilities seek to exercise their rights. It discusses the compounding nature of discrimination to which young persons with disabilities are too often subjected because of their disabilities, their youth, and their gender. It highlights the ways in which young persons with disabilities are vulnerable to violence, especially gender-based violence, and the barriers they face when seeking services and obtaining support to respond to such violence. It discusses the challenges of accessing and exercising SRHR, made more difficult because of inaccessibility, absence of autonomy, and limited empowerment, among other things. The report emphasises how time and space can have profound effects on the ability of young persons with disabilities to access their rights to health and safety. In humanitarian crises and low-resource environments, young persons with disabilities are often the last to receive meaningful attention. Institutionalisation of young persons with disabilities remains far too common and places young people within spaces in which the denial of their rights is routine and rates of violence profound. The report also lays out the international and regional normative frameworks establishing states’ obligations to prevent and respond to violence against young persons with disabilities and to ensure their access to and enjoyment of SRHR. It includes effective strategies to prevent and respond to GBV and includes case studies of promising programmes at the international, regional, and state level and describes good practices in fostering the realisation of SRHR for young persons with disabilities. The report discusses the importance of inclusion, partnership, and engagement of CSOs in all phases of policy and programme development and contains detailed recommendations for action to ensure that young persons with disabilities can achieve the full enjoyment of their rights.""" ;

The study was designed to answer whether (1) light or exogenous inorganic carbon (Ci) pool is driving growth; and (2) elevated CO2(aq) concentration under ocean acidification (OA) will downregulate CAext-mediated inline image dehydration and alter the stable carbon isotope ($δ$13C) signatures toward more CO2 use to support higher growth rate. At pHT 9.0 where CO2(aq) is \\textless1 $μ$mol L−1, inhibition of the known inline image use mechanisms, that is, direct inline image uptake through the AE port and CAext-mediated inline image dehydration decreased net photosynthesis (NPS) by only 56–83%, leaving the carbon uptake mechanism for the remaining 17–44% of the NPS unaccounted. An in silico search for carbon-concentrating mechanism elements in expressed sequence tag libraries of Ulva found putative light-dependent inline image transporters to which the remaining NPS can be attributed. The shift in $δ$13C signatures from –22‰ toward –10‰ under saturating light but not under elevated CO2(aq) suggest preference and substantial inline image use to support photosynthesis and growth. U. rigida is Ci saturated, and growth was primarily controlled by light. Therefore, increased levels of CO2(aq) predicted for the future will not, in isolation, stimulate Ulva blooms." ;

    :description "Mg/Ca ratios of planktonic foraminiferal tests are important tools for reconstructing past ocean temperatures at different levels of the upper water column. Yet numerous studies suggest a significant influence of calcite dissolution on Mg/Ca ratios lowering their initial signal recorded within a planktonic foraminiferal habitat. To determine the effect of dissolution, this study presents Mg/Ca ratios of eight planktonic foraminiferal species from the South China Sea sediment surface. Continuously decreasing with increasing water depth, the Mg/Ca ratios also decrease with calcite-saturation states close to and below saturation (bottom water inline image) but are stable in well calcite-supersaturated bottom waters (\\textgreater40 $μ$mol kg−1). This preservation pattern compares well with examples of Mg/Ca dissolution from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and is independent of the foraminiferal species. Merging a global data set by separate normalization of 79 Mg/Ca data sets from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, which removes thermal differences between the ocean regions and foraminiferal species, enabled us to quantify a global decrease in planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios of 0.054 ±0.019 $μ$mol mol−1 per $μ$mol kg−1 below a critical threshold for dissolution of 21.3 ±6.6 $μ$mol kg−1. The absolute decline in Mg/Ca ratios, which is similar for all species, affects temperature estimates from (sub-)thermocline species more strongly than those from shallow dwellers. The water depth of this critical threshold in the global oceans shoals from \\textgreater3.5 km in the North Atlantic to \\textless0.5 km in the North Pacific based on calculations of the global calcite-saturation state from 6321 hydrographic stations. Above this critical threshold Mg/Ca ratios are well preserved, and paleotemperature estimates are broadly unaffected by dissolution." ;

    :description "Bar-built estuaries are coastal environments characterized by the partial closure of the estuary's mouth with a sandbar barrier for extended periods (closed state). Through natural events (rainfall) or anthropogenic influences, the sandbar is breached, reopening the estuary to the ocean. The transition from closed to open state often leads to extensive physical and chemical changes in the estuarine conditions, as water mixing and sediment resuspension are increased, which could result in the oxidation of sediment acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). We followed monthly changes in water's and sediment geochemical characteristics at thirty-two sites spanning the Pescadero Estuary over a one-year period. We showed that the transition from closed to open state leads to significant decreases in aqueous pH to circumneutral values and significant increases in aqueous hydrogen sulfide and iron concentrations to 10.6 $μ$M and 59.1 $μ$M, respectively, due to sediment AVS oxidation following sediment resuspension. Aqueous hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in both closed and open states were significantly higher than the recommended thresholds for aquatic life. Moreover, mildly acidic water conditions in the open state were lower than the recommended limits for aquatic life. Our spatial analysis further highlighted that some parts of the estuary were more vulnerable to decreased water quality. Indeed, high sediment AVS contents (19–24 mmol kg− 1) were observed year-round at the River Confluence and Butano Creek regions, which implies a high potential for severe water acidification and metal release when the estuary transitions from closed to open state." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification and warming are expected to threaten the persistence of tropical coral reef ecosystems. As coral reefs face multiple stressors, the distribution and abundance of corals will depend on the successful dispersal and settlement of coral larvae under changing environmental conditions. To explore this scenario, we used metabolic rate, at holobiont and molecular levels, as an index for assessing the physiological plasticity of Pocillopora damicornis larvae from this site to conditions of ocean acidity and warming. Larvae were incubated for 6 hours in seawater containing combinations of CO2 concentration (450 and 950 microatm) and temperature (28 and 30 degrees C). Rates of larval oxygen consumption were higher at elevated temperatures. In contrast, high CO2 levels elicited depressed metabolic rates, especially for larvae released later in the spawning period. Rates of citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic metabolism, suggested a biochemical limit for increasing oxidative capacity in coral larvae in a warming, acidifying ocean. Biological responses were also compared between larvae released from adult colonies on the same day (cohorts). The metabolic physiology of Pocillopora damicornis larvae varied significantly by day of release. Additionally, we used environmental data collected on a reef in Moorea, French Polynesia to provide information about what adult corals and larvae may currently experience in the field. An autonomous pH sensor provided a continuous time series of pH on the natal fringing reef. In February/March, 2011, pH values averaged 8.075+/-0.023. Our results suggest that without adaptation or acclimatization, only a portion of naive Pocillopora damicornis larvae may have suitable metabolic phenotypes for maintaining function and fitness in an end-of-the century ocean." ;

    :description "Although there is a substantial body of work on how temperature shapes coastal marine ecosystems, the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pH and corresponding in situ biological responses remain largely unknown across biogeographic ranges of tropical coral species. Environmental variability is important to characterize because it can amplify or dampen the biological consequences of global change, depending on the functional relationship between mean temperature or pH and organismal traits. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal variability of pH, temperature, and salinity at fringing reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia and Nanwan Bay, Taiwan using advanced time series analysis, including wavelet analysis, and infer their potential impact on the persistence and stability of coral populations. Our results demonstrate that both the mean and variance of pH and temperature differed significantly between sites in Moorea and Taiwan. Seawater temperature at the Moorea site passed the local bleaching threshold several times within the ̃45 day deployment while aragonite saturation state at the Taiwan site was often below commonly observed levels for coral reefs. Our results showcase how a better understanding of the differences in environmental conditions between sites can (1) provide an important frame of reference for designing laboratory experiments to study the effects of environmental variability, (2) identify the proximity of current environmental conditions to predicted biological thresholds for the coral reef, and (3) help predict when the temporal variability and mean of environmental conditions will interact synergistically or antagonistically to alter the abundance and stability of marine populations experiencing climate change." ;

    :description "As global ocean change progresses, reef-building corals and their early life history stages will rely on physiological plasticity to tolerate new environmental conditions. Larvae from brooding coral species contain algal symbionts upon release, which assist with the energy requirements of dispersal and metamorphosis. Global ocean change threatens the success of larval dispersal and settlement by challenging the performance of the larvae and of the symbiosis. In this study, larvae of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis were exposed to elevated pCO2 and temperature to examine the performance of the coral and its symbionts in situ and better understand the mechanisms of physiological plasticity and stress tolerance in response to multiple stressors. We generated a de novo holobiont transcriptome containing coral host and algal symbiont transcripts and bioinformatically filtered the assembly into host and symbiont components for downstream analyses. Seventeen coral genes were differentially expressed in response to the combined effects of pCO2 and temperature. In the symbiont, 89 genes were differentially expressed in response to pCO2. Our results indicate that many of the whole-organism (holobiont) responses previously observed for P. damicornis larvae in scenarios of ocean acidification and warming may reflect the physiological capacity of larvae to cope with the environmental changes without expressing additional protective mechanisms. At the holobiont level, the results suggest that the responses of symbionts to future ocean conditions could play a large role in shaping success of coral larval stages." ;

    :description "Declining health of scleractinian corals in response to deteriorating environmental conditions is widely acknowledged, however links between physiological and functional genomic responses of corals are less well understood. Here we explore growth and the expression of 20 target genes with putative roles in metabolism and calcification in the branching coral, Acropora millepora, in two separate experiments: 1) elevated pCO2 (464, 822, 1187 and 1638 $μ$atm) and ambient temperature (27 °C), and 2) elevated pCO2 (490 and 822 $μ$atm) and temperature (28 and 31 °C). After 14 days of exposure to elevated pCO2 and ambient temperatures, no evidence of differential expression of either calcification or metabolism genes was detected between control and elevated pCO2 treatments. After 37 days of exposure to control and elevated pCO2, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-C Reductase Subunit 2 gene (QCR2; a gene involved in complex III of the electron chain transport within the mitochondria and critical for generation of ATP) was significantly down-regulated in the elevated pCO2 treatment in both ambient and elevated temperature treatments. Overall, the general absence of a strong response to elevated pCO2 and temperature by the other 19 targeted calcification and metabolism genes suggests that corals may not be affected by these stressors on longer time scales (37 days). These results also highlight the potential for QCR2 to act as a biomarker of coral genomic responses to changing environments." ;

    :description "By the end of this century, anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are expected to decrease the surface ocean pH by as much as 0.3 unit. At the same time, the ocean is expected to warm with an associated expansion of the oxygen minimum layer (OML). Thus, there is a growing demand to understand the response of the marine biota to these global changes. We show that ocean acidification will substantially depress metabolic rates (31%) and activity levels (45%) in the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, a top predator in the Eastern Pacific. This effect is exacerbated by high temperature. Reduced aerobic and locomotory scope in warm, high-CO2 surface waters will presumably impair predator–prey interactions with cascading consequences for growth, reproduction, and survival. Moreover, as the OML shoals, squids will have to retreat to these shallower, less hospitable, waters at night to feed and repay any oxygen debt that accumulates during their diel vertical migration into the OML. Thus, we demonstrate that, in the absence of adaptation or horizontal migration, the synergism between ocean acidification, global warming, and expanding hypoxia will compress the habitable depth range of the species. These interactions may ultimately define the long-term fate of this commercially and ecologically important predator." ;

    :description "Context  Regime shifts are well known for driving penetrating ecological change, yet we do not recognise the consequences of these shifts much beyond species diversity and productivity. Sound represents a multidimensional space that carries decision-making information needed for some dispersing species to locate resources and evaluate their quantity and quality.  Objectives  Here we assessed the effect of regime shifts on marine soundscapes, which we propose has the potential function of strengthening the positive or negative feedbacks that mediate ecosystem shifts.  Methods  We tested whether biologically relevant cues are altered by regime shifts in kelp forests and seagrass systems and how specific such shifted soundscapes are to the type of driver; i.e. local pollution (eutrophication) vs. global change (ocean acidification).  Results  Here, we not only provide the first evidence for regime-shifted soundscapes, but also reveal that the modified cues of shifted ecosystems are similar regardless of spatial scale and type of environmental driver. Importantly, biological sounds can act as functional cues for orientation by dispersing larvae, and observed shifts in soundscape loudness may alter this function.  Conclusions  These results open the question as to whether shifted soundscapes provide a functional role in mediating the positive or negative feedbacks that govern the arrival of species associated with driving change or stasis in ecosystem state." ;

    :description "There is growing concern that global environmental change might exacerbate the ecological impacts of invasive species by increasing their per capita effects on native species. However, the mechanisms underlying such shifts in interaction strength are poorly understood. Here, we test whether ocean acidification, driven by elevated seawater pCO2, increases the susceptibility of native Olympia oysters to predation by invasive snails. Oysters raised under elevated pCO2 experienced a 20% increase in drilling predation. When presented alongside control oysters in a choice experiment, 48% more high-CO2 oysters were consumed. The invasive snails were tolerant of elevated CO2 with no change in feeding behaviour. Oysters raised under acidified conditions did not have thinner shells, but were 29–40% smaller than control oysters, and these smaller individuals were consumed at disproportionately greater rates. Reduction in prey size is a common response to environmental stress that may drive increasing per capita effects of stress-tolerant invasive predators. " ;

This occurs despite their exposure to naturally low dissolved oxygen (DO) waters (\\textless60 $μ$mol kg−1) associated with the Oxygen Limited Zone and low-pH waters undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate ($Ømega$CaCO3 \\textless 1). Here we present vertical depth distribution and density analyses of historical otter trawl data collected in the Southern California Bight (SCB) from 1994–2013 to address the question: Do changes in echinoid density and species' depth distributions along the continental margin in the SCB reflect observed secular or interannual changes in climate? Deep-dwelling burrowing urchins (Brissopsis pacifica, Brisaster spp. and Spatangus californicus), which are adapted to low-DO, low-pH conditions appeared to have expanded their vertical distributions and populations upslope over the past decade (2003–2013), and densities of the deep pink urchin, Strongylocentrotus fragilis, increased significantly in the upper 500 m of the SCB. Conversely, the shallower urchin, Lytechinus pictus, exhibited depth shoaling and density decreases within the upper 200 m of the SCB from 1994 to 2013. Oxygen and pH in the SCB also vary inter-annually due to varying strengths of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Changes in depth distributions and densities were correlated with bi-monthly ENSO climate indices in the region. Our results suggest that both a secular trend in ocean deoxygenation and acidification and varying strength of ENSO may be linked to echinoid species distributions and densities, creating habitat compression in some and habitat expansion in others. Potential life-history mechanisms underlying depth and density changes observed over these time periods include migration, mortality, and recruitment. These types of analyses are needed for a broad suite of benthic species in order to identify and manage climate-sensitive species on the margin." ;

    :description "The climate change focus in Australia has shifted from mitigation to adaptation with an emphasis on place-specific case studies. The Barwon Estuary Complex (BEC) on the Bellarine Peninsula, central Victoria, was the focus of this place-specific study in which 37 local stakeholders were consulted through a series of semi-structured interviews on the impacts of climate change on their coastal community. Overall there was uniformity in stakeholder perceptions of the climate change impacts and vulnerabilities pertaining to the BEC. In contrast, discussion on adaptation drew a diversity of responses. While 53 per cent of stakeholders indicated a need to limit the use of hard structures, and rather plan around a changing estuarine environment, opinion amongst the community group was divided. Some believed ‘retreat is the only option' whilst others felt ‘there won't be much leaving'. The present level of confusion around adaptation highlights the imperative of commencing discussions now to allow sufficient time to develop strategies which are both environmentally and socially responsible. This is important as ultimately it will be the community that will determine whether adaptation strategies are adopted or met with resistance.  " ;

    :description "Large and productive fisheries occur in regions experiencing or projected to experience ocean acidification. Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) constitute the world's largest single-species fishery and live in one of the ocean's highest pCO2 regions. We investigated the relationship of the distribution and abundance of Anchoveta eggs and larvae to natural gradients in pCO2 in the Peruvian upwelling system. Eggs and larvae, zooplankton, and data on temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and pCO2 were collected during a cruise off Peru in 2013. pCO2 ranged from 167-1392 µatm and explained variability in egg presence, an index of spawning habitat. Zooplankton abundance explained variability in the abundance of small larvae. Within the main spawning and larva habitats (6-10°S), eggs were found in cool, low-salinity, and both extremely low (less than 200 µatm) and high (more than 900 µatm) pCO2 waters, and larvae were collected in warmer, higher salinity, and moderate (400-600 µatm) pCO2 waters. Our data support the hypothesis that Anchoveta preferentially spawned at high pCO2 and these eggs had lower survival. Enhanced understanding of the influence of pCO2 on Anchoveta spawning and larva mortality, together with pCO2 measurements, may enable predictions of ocean acidification effects on Anchoveta and inform adaptive fisheries management." ;

    :description "Although the effect of ocean acidification on fertilization success of marine organisms is increasingly well documented, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. The fertilization success of broadcast spawning invertebrates depends on successful sperm-egg collisions, gamete fusion, and standard generation of Ca2+ oscillations. Therefore, the realistic effects of future ocean pCO2 levels on these specific aspects of fertilization of Tegillarca granosa were investigated in the present study through sperm velocity trials, fertilization kinetics model analysis, and intracellular Ca2+ assays, respectively. Results obtained indicated that ocean acidification significantly reduced the fertilization success of T. granosa, which could be accountable by (i) decreased sperm velocity hence reducing the probability for sperm-egg collisions; (ii) lowered probability of gamete fusion for each gamete collision event; and (iii) disrupted intracellular Ca2+ oscillations." ;

    :description "There is a long history of examining the impacts of nutrient pollution and pH on coral reefs. However, little is known about how these two stressors interact and influence coral reef ecosystem functioning. Using a six-week nutrient addition experiment, we measured the impact of elevated nitrate (NO−3) and phosphate (PO3−4) on net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) rates of individual taxa and combined reef communities. Our study had four major outcomes: (i) NCC rates declined in response to nutrient addition in all substrate types, (ii) the mixed community switched from net calcification to net dissolution under medium and high nutrient conditions, (iii) nutrients augmented pH variability through modified photosynthesis and respiration rates, and (iv) nutrients disrupted the relationship between NCC and aragonite saturation state documented in ambient conditions. These results indicate that the negative effect of NO−3 and PO3−4 addition on reef calcification is likely both a direct physiological response to nutrients and also an indirect response to a shifting pH environment from altered NCP rates. Here, we show that nutrient pollution could make reefs more vulnerable to global changes associated with ocean acidification and accelerate the predicted shift from net accretion to net erosion." ;

    :description "The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on photosynthesis and calcification in the calcifying algae Halimeda macroloba and Halimeda cylindracea and the symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis were investigated through exposure to a combination of four temperatures (28°C, 30°C, 32°C, and 34°C) and four CO2 levels (39, 61, 101, and 203 Pa; pH 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, and 7.4, respectively). Elevated CO2 caused a profound decline in photosynthetic efficiency (FV : FM), calcification, and growth in all species. After five weeks at 34°C under all CO2 levels, all species died. Chlorophyll (Chl) a and b concentration in Halimeda spp. significantly decreased in 203 Pa, 32°C and 34°C treatments, but Chl a and Chl c2 concentration in M. vertebralis was not affected by temperature alone, with significant declines in the 61, 101, and 203 Pa treatments at 28°C. Significant decreases in FV : FM in all species were found after 5 weeks of exposure to elevated CO2 (203 Pa in all temperature treatments) and temperature (32°C and 34°C in all pH treatments). The rate of oxygen production declined at 61, 101, and 203 Pa in all temperature treatments for all species. The elevated CO2 and temperature treatments greatly reduced calcification (growth and crystal size) in M. vertebralis and, to a lesser extent, in Halimeda spp. These findings indicate that 32°C and 101 Pa CO2, are the upper limits for survival of these species on Heron Island reef, and we conclude that these species will be highly vulnerable to the predicted future climate change scenarios of elevated temperature and ocean acidification.

    :description "Rapid anthropogenic production of CO2 has driven the carbonate chemistry of the sea, causing lowered pH in surface waters. Increasingly, scientists are called on to study ocean acidification and its effects. The ‘minor' phylum Bryozoa shows considerable potential in understanding temperate southern hemisphere shelf carbonate dynamics, thus complementing tropical studies based mainly on corals. Lowered pH affects skeletons differently depending on their composition, but skeletons are even more strongly affected by morphology. Different bryozoans will manifest the effects of acidification at different times, thus some particularly vulnerable species may act as ‘canaries' providing an early warning for some shelf communities, such as bryozoan-dominated thickets. A carbonate budget based on several studies of the bryozoan Adeonellopsis in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, shows that increasing dissolution pressure in cool temperate environments dramatically reduces sediment accumulation rates. Bryozoan shelf carbonate sediments, which blanket the southern shelves of New Zealand and Australia, may serve as biological saturometers, monitoring the effects of acidification over shelf depths. Whether acting as canaries, models or sentinels, bryozoans have great potential to provide insight into the next global challenge: ocean acidification." ;

    :description "The cheilostome bryozoan Melicerita chathamensis from the continental shelf around southern New Zealand is unusual in having macroscopic annual growth checks. It thus presents an opportunity to examine annual variations in age, growth, calcification and carbonate mineralogy in a temperate bryozoan. Forty-one colonies dredged south of Snares Islands, New Zealand (47° 49.537′S, 166° 45.910′E, 166 m water depth, 2 February 2008) ranged from 2 to 9 years old and were up to 40 mm long. Segment length varied from 0.94 to 13.67 mm, with a mean growth rate of 5.27 mm y-1, whereas segment weight varied from 0.1 to 37 mg, with an average calcification rate of 9.2 mg y-1. Low-Mg calcite ranged from 0.8 to 3.6 wt% MgCO3, with a mean of 2.1 wt% MgCO3, whereas high-Mg calcite ranged from 6.6 wt% MgCO3 to 9.7 wt% MgCO3 with a mean of 8.1 wt% MgCO3. The well-studied polar M. obliqua, in contrast, grows more slowly over a much longer period and calcifies more rapidly, suggesting that polar bryozoans may be more effective at sequestering carbon than their temperate counterparts. The proportion of each mineral in skeletal segments generally varied with age, from almost entirely high-Mg calcite in the oldest segments to entirely low-Mg calcite at the growing tips, with a mean of 60.7% high Mg calcite. This unusual dual-calcite mineralogy appears to be analogous to some other cheilostomes which also produce a primary skeleton of low-Mg calcite but their secondary mineral is aragonite. Such bimineralic bryozoans, which are sophisticated mineralisers that exert a great deal of control over their skeletal composition, may be able to mineralise despite decreasing sea-water pH. Bimineral skeletal sediments, however, could be especially vulnerable to dissolution, as both aragonite and high-Mg calcite are more soluble than low-Mg calcite. Weakening of the skeleton by dissolution of secondary thickening could increase the likely effects of temperate abrasion and bioerosion." ;

    :description "Most marine sponges precipitate silicate skeletal elements, and it has been predicted that they would be among the few “winners” among invertebrates in an acidifying, high-CO2 ocean. But members of Class Calcarea and a small proportion of the Demospongiae have calcified skeletal structures, which puts them among those calcifying organisms which are vulnerable to lowered pH and CO3= availability. A review of carbonate mineralogy in marine sponges (75 specimens, 32 species), along with new data from New Zealand (42 specimens in 15 species) allows us to investigate patterns and make predictions. In general sponges show little variability within individuals and within species (+/- 0.5 wt% MgCO3 in calcite). Extant sponges in Class Calcarea generally produce calcitic spicules with relatively high Mg contents, up to 15 wt% MgCO3. Whereas most of the calcifying demosponges are aragonitic, the genus Acanthochaetetes in the Hadromerida produces extremely high-Mg calcite (14 to 18 wt% MgCO3). There is generally a weak phylogenetic consistency among classes, orders and families. Statistical analyses, including those accounting for these phylogenetic effects, fail to find a substantial or significant effect of water temperature on mineralogical variation. In the context of global ocean acidification, sponges which produce high-Mg calcite and/or aragonite will be most vulnerable to dissolution, meaning that not all sponges will be “winners” in a high-CO2 ocean." ;

-INDIVIDUAL: Individual characteristics, education, economic activity, income and fertility.

The scope of the early Cook Islands censuses was limited, in fact they consisted of head counts only. With the passage of time the census has expanded. Gradually, questions on sex, age, marital status, religion, education, employment, etc have been included. Questions on unpaid work and income earned were included for the first time in the 1996 Census. In the 2001 Census, questions on disability and waste management was included.
A personal questionnaire is completed for every man, woman and child alive at midnight on census night within the geographical boundaries of the Cook Islands. The Census excludes those persons on foreign vessels, yachts and aircraft flying through or stopping temporarily (transit). A dwelling questionnaire is completed for every occupied dwelling as at midnight on census night.

The format of the questionnaires for the 2001 Census of Population and Dwellings was similar to that of the 1996 Census. The dwelling questionnaire contained 26 questions, requesting information on the number of persons in the dwelling, type of dwelling, year dwelling was constructed, appliances and amenities, subsistence agricultural and fishing activities, etc.
The personal questionnaire was split into several parts:
Questions 1 to 6 - relates to every person in the Cook Islands on census night.
Questions 7 to 11(ii) - relates to every person in the Cook Islands on census night excluding visitors and those that were currently serving a sentence in jail.
Questions 11(iii) - relates to every person over the age of 1 year.
Questions 11(iv) to 12(d) - relates to every person over the age of 5 years.
Questions 12(e) to Q21 - relates to every person over the age of 15 years.
Questions 22 - relates only to females 15 years and over.

The Cook Islands are geographically divided into a number of Census Districts coinciding with the electoral boundaries, and these were further divided into enumeration areas. An enumerator is then assigned to collect the census forms for each enumeration area.""" ;

·	Non-employing units (e.g., market sellers);

The enterprise is an institutional unit and generally corresponds to legal entities such as a company, cooperative, partnership or sole proprietorship. The establishment is an institutional unit or part of an institutional unit, which engages in one, or predominantly one, type of economic activity. Sufficient data must be available to derive or meaningfully estimate value added in order to recognize an establishment.

    :description "Stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements on biogenic calcite and aragonite have become standard tools for reconstructing past oceanographic and climatic change. In aquatic organisms, super(18)O / super(16)O ratios in the shell carbonate are a function of the ratio in the sea water and the calcification temperature. In contrast, super13C/ super(12)C ratios are controlled by the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea water and physiological processes such as respiration and symbiont photosynthesis. These geochemical proxies have been used with analyses of foraminifera shells to reconstruct global ice volumes, surface and deep ocean temperatures, ocean circulation changes and glacial-interglacial exchange between the terrestrial and oceanic carbon pools. Here, we report experimental measurements on living symbiotic and non-symbiotic plankton foraminifera (Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides respectively) showing that the super13C/ super(12)C and super(18)O/ super(16)O ratios of the calcite shells decrease with increasing seawater [CO sub(3) super(2-)]. Because glacial-period oceans had higher pH and [CO sub(3) super(2-)] than today, these new relationships confound the standard interpretation of glacial foraminiferal stable-isotope data. In particular, the hypothesis that the glacial-interglacial shift in the super13C/ super(12)C ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon into the ocean can be explained alternatively by an increase in ocean alkalinity. A carbonate-concentration effect could also help explain some of the extreme stable-isotope variations during the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic aeons." ;

    :description "Understanding functional trait distributions among organisms can inform impacts on and responses to environmental change. In marine systems, only 1% of dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater exists as CO2. Thus the majority of marine macrophytes not only passively access CO2 for photosynthesis, but also actively transport CO2 and the more common bicarbonate (HCO3-, 92% of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon) into their cells. Because species with these carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) are non-randomly distributed in ecosystems, we ask whether there is a phylogenetic pattern to the distribution of CCMs among algal species. To determine macrophyte traits that influence carbon uptake, we assessed 40 common macrophyte species from the rocky intertidal community of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to a) query whether macrophytes have a CCM and b) determine the evolutionary history of CCMs, using ancestral state reconstructions and stochastic character mapping based on previously published data. Thirty-two species not only depleted CO2, but also concentrated and depleted HCO3-, indicative of a CCM. While analysis of CCMs as a continuous trait in 30 families within Phylum Rhodophyta showed a significant phylogenetic signal under a Brownian motion model, analysis of CCMs as a discrete trait (presence or absence) indicated that red algal families are more divergent than expected in their CCM presence or absence; CCMs are a labile trait within the Rhodophyta. In contrast, CCMs were present in each of 18 Ochrophyta families surveyed, indicating that CCMs are highly conserved in the brown algae. The trait of CCM presence or absence was largely conserved within Families. Fifteen of 23 species tested also changed the seawater buffering capacity, or Total Alkalinity (TA), shifting DIC composition towards increasing concentrations of HCO3 - and CO2 for photosynthesis. Manipulating the external TA of the local  nvironmentmay influence carbon availability in boundary layers and areas of low water mixing, offering an additional mechanism to increase CO2 availability." ;

    :description "An enormous amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) has been dissolved into the ocean, leading to a lower pH and changes in the chemical properties of seawater, which has been termed ocean acidification (OA). The impacts of pCO2-driven acidification on immunity have been revealed recently in various marine organisms. However, the mechanism causing the reduction in phagocytosis still remains unclear. Therefore, the impacts of pCO2-driven OA at present and near-future levels (pH values of 8.1, 7.8, and 7.4) on the rate of phagocytosis, the abundance of cytoskeleton components, the levels of nitric oxide (NO), and the concentration and activity of lysozymes (LZM) of hemocytes were investigated in a commercial bivalve species, the blood clam (Tegillarca granosa). In addition, the effects of OA on the expression of genes regulating actin skeleton and nitric oxide synthesis 2 (NOS2) were also analyzed. The results obtained showed that the phagocytic rate, cytoskeleton component abundance, concentration and activity of LZM of hemocytes were all significantly reduced after a 2-week exposure to the future OA scenario of a pH of 7.4. On the contrary, a remarkable increase in the concentration of NO compared to that of the control was detected in clams exposed to OA. Furthermore, the expression of genes regulating the actin cytoskeleton and NOS were significantly up-regulated after OA exposure. Though the mechanism causing phagocytosis seemed to be complicated based on the results obtained in the present study and those reported previously, our results suggested that OA may reduce the phagocytosis of hemocytes by (1) decreasing the abundance of cytoskeleton components and therefore hampering the cytoskeleton-mediated process of engulfment, (2) reducing the concentration and activity of LZM and therefore constraining the degradation of the engulfed pathogen through an oxygen-independent pathway, and (3) inducing the production of NO, which may negatively regulate immune responses." ;

    :description "Hypoxia and ocean acidification are two consequences of anthropogenic activities. These global trends occur on top of natural variability. In environments such as estuarine areas, short-term acute pH and O2 fluctuations are occurring simultaneously. The present study tested the combined effects of short-term seawater acidification and hypoxia on the physiology and energy budget of the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. Mussels were exposed for 72 h to six combined treatments with three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.3) and two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (2 mg L−1, 6 mg L−1). Clearance rate (CR), food absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR), ammonium excretion rate (ER), O:N ratio and scope for growth (SFG) were significantly reduced, and faecal organic dry weight ratio (E) was significantly increased at low DO. Low pH did not lead to a reduced SFG. Interactive effects of pH and DO were observed for CR, E and RR. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed positive relationships among most physiological indicators, especially between SFG and CR under normal DO conditions. These results demonstrate that Mytilus coruscus was sensitive to short-term (72 h) exposure to decreased O2 especially if combined with decreased pH levels. In conclusion, the short-term oxygen and pH variation significantly induced physiological changes of mussels with some interactive effects." ;

    :description "Increasing seawater temperatures and CO2 levels associated with climate change affect the shallow marine ecosystem function. In this study, the effects of elevated seawater temperature and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) on subtropical sediment systems of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef lagoon habitats of Okinawa, Japan, were examined. Sediment and seawater from each habitat were exposed to four pCO2-temperature treatments, including ambient pCO2- ambient temperature, ambient pCO2-high temperature (ambient temperature + 4°C), high pCO2 (936 ppm)-ambient temperature, and high pCO2-high temperature. Parameters including primary production, nutrient flux, pigment content, photosynthetic community composition, and bacterial abundance were examined. Neither high temperature nor high pCO2 alone impacted mangrove and seagrass sediment primary production significantly (Tukey's test, P \\textgreater 0.05). However, the combined stress significantly (Tukey's test, P \\textless 0.01) increased primary production in these two habitats. In sediments from the coral reef lagoon, single and combined stress treatments induced a shift from heterotrophy to autotrophy. Significant increases in net primary production (Tukey's test, P \\textless 0.01), and gross primary production (Tukey's test, P \\textless 0.05) under the combined stress suggested that benthic microalgae in mangrove and seagrass sediments were more responsive to high temperature and pCO2 conditions than those in coral reef lagoon sediments. Additionally, combined stress significantly increased the sediment chlorophyll a content (Tukey's test, P \\textless 0.05) in all habitats. These increases were associated with increased net primary production, indicating that combined stress stimulates primary production activity by the photosynthetic benthic microalgae in all habitats. Diatom activity increased, as silicate uptake increased in all habitats. Microbial abundance significantly increased under the combined stress treatment (Tukey's test, P \\textless 0.01), but did not exceed autotrophic activity. Respiration did not change significantly in any of the three habitats (Tukey's test, P \\textgreater 0.05) under the combined stress, suggesting that heterotrophic processes were less affected by the combined stress than autotrophic processes. In summary, mangrove and seagrass sediments minimize the negative impacts of elevated temperature and pCO2 via increased primary production and carbon storage. Lagoonal sediments also act as a carbon sink under temperature and ocean acidification stress." ;

The results demonstrated that seawater acidification had little effect on the cellular mortality and granulocyte proportion but damaged the granulocyte ultrastructure. Phagocytosis of haemocytes was also significantly inhibited in a clearly concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating that the immune function was affected. Moreover, ROS production was significantly induced in both CO2 and HCl treatments, and four antioxidant components, GSH, GST, GR and GPx, had active responses to the acidification stress. Comparatively, CO2 had more severe destructive effects on haemocytes than HCl at the same pH level, indicating that CO2 stressed cells in other ways beyond the increasing H(+) concentration. One possible explanation was that seawater acidification induced ROS overproduction, which damaged the ultrastructure of haemocytes and decreased phagocytosis." ;

    :description "The global acidification of the earth's oceans is predicted to impact biodiversity via physiological effects impacting growth, survival, reproduction, and immunology, leading to changes in species abundances and global distributions. However, the degree to which these changes will play out critically depends on the evolutionary rate at which populations will respond to natural selection imposed by ocean acidification, which remains largely unquantified. Here we measure the potential for an evolutionary response to ocean acidification in larval development rate in two coastal invertebrates using a full-factorial breeding design. We show that the sea urchin species Strongylocentrotus franciscanus has vastly greater levels of phenotypic and genetic variation for larval size in future CO2 conditions compared to the mussel species Mytilus trossulus. Using these measures we demonstrate that S. franciscanus may have faster evolutionary responses within 50 years of the onset of predicted year-2100 CO2 conditions despite having lower population turnover rates. Our comparisons suggest that information on genetic variation, phenotypic variation, and key demographic parameters, may lend valuable insight into relative evolutionary potentials across a large number of species.

    :description "ABSTRACT:  Levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) projected to occur in the world's oceans in the near future have been reported to increase swimming activity and impair predator recognition in coral reef fishes. These behavioral alterations would be expected to have dramatic effects on survival and community dynamics in marine ecosystems in the future. To investigate the universality and replicability of these observations, we used juvenile spiny chromis damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to examine the effects of long-term CO2 exposure on routine activity and the behavioral response to the chemical cues of a predator (Cephalopholis urodeta). Commencing at ̃3-20 days post-hatch, juvenile damselfish were exposed to present-day CO2 levels (\\̃420 $μ$atm) or to levels forecasted for the year 2100 (\\~̃1000 $μ$atm) for 3 months of their development. Thereafter, we assessed routine activity before and after injections of seawater (sham injection, control) or seawater-containing predator chemical cues. There was no effect of CO2 treatment on routine activity levels before or after the injections. All fish decreased their swimming activity following the predator cue injection but not following the sham injection, regardless of CO2 treatment. Our results corroborate findings from a growing number of studies reporting limited or no behavioral responses of fishes to elevated CO2. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:  Alarmingly, it has been reported that levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) forecasted for the year 2100 cause coral reef fishes to be attracted to the chemical cues of predators. However, most studies have exposed the fish to CO2 for very short periods before behavioral testing. Using long-term acclimation to elevated CO2 and automated tracking software, we found that fish exposed to elevated CO2 showed the same behavioral patterns as control fish exposed to present-day CO2 levels. Specifically, activity levels were the same between groups, and fish acclimated to elevated CO2 decreased their swimming activity to the same degree as control fish when presented with cues from a predator. These findings indicate that behavioral impacts of elevated CO2 levels are not universal in coral reef fishes." ;

    :description "One of the major challenges to assessing the impact of ocean acidification on marine life is detecting and interpreting long-term change in the context of natural variability. This study addresses this need through a global synthesis of monthly pH and aragonite saturation state ($Ømega$arag) climatologies for 12 open ocean, coastal, and coral reef locations using 3-hourly moored observations of surface seawater partial pressure of CO2 and pH collected together since as early as 2010. Mooring observations suggest open ocean subtropical and subarctic sites experience present-day surface pH and $Ømega$arag conditions outside the bounds of preindustrial variability throughout most, if not all, of the year. In general, coastal mooring sites experience more natural variability and thus, more overlap with preindustrial conditions; however, present-day $Ømega$arag conditions surpass biologically relevant thresholds associated with ocean acidification impacts on Mytilus californianus ($Ømega$arag \\textless 1.8) and Crassostrea gigas ($Ømega$arag \\textless 2.0) larvae in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and Mya arenaria larvae in the Gulf of Maine ($Ømega$arag \\textless 1.6). At the most variable mooring locations in coastal systems of the CCE, subseasonal conditions approached $Ømega$arag =  1. Global and regional models and data syntheses of ship-based observations tended to underestimate seasonal variability compared to mooring observations. Efforts such as this to characterize all patterns of pH and $Ømega$arag variability and change at key locations are fundamental to assessing present-day biological impacts of ocean acidification, further improving experimental design to interrogate organism response under real-world conditions, and improving predictive models and vulnerability assessments seeking to quantify the broader impacts of ocean acidification." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification and greenhouse warming will interactively influence competitive success of key phytoplankton groups such as diatoms, but how long-term responses to global change will affect community structure is unknown. We incubated a mixed natural diatom community from coastal New Zealand waters in a short-term (two-week) incubation experiment using a factorial matrix of warming and/or elevated pCO2 and measured effects on community structure. We then isolated the dominant diatoms in clonal cultures and conditioned them for 1 year under the same temperature and pCO2 conditions from which they were isolated, in order to allow for extended selection or acclimation by these abiotic environmental change factors in the absence of interspecific interactions. These conditioned isolates were then recombined into ‘artificial' communities modelled after the original natural assemblage and allowed to compete under conditions identical to those in the short-term natural community experiment. In general, the resulting structure of both the unconditioned natural community and conditioned ‘artificial' community experiments was similar, despite differences such as the loss of two species in the latter. pCO2 and temperature had both individual and interactive effects on community structure, but temperature was more influential, as warming significantly reduced species richness. In this case, our short-term manipulative experiment with a mixed natural assemblage spanning weeks served as a reasonable proxy to predict the effects of global change forcing on diatom community structure after the component species were conditioned in isolation over an extended timescale. Future studies will be required to assess whether or not this is also the case for other types of algal communities from other marine regimes." ;

    :description "Diatoms are often considered to be a single functional group, yet there is a great deal of morphological, genetic and ecological diversity within the class. How these differences will translate into species-specific responses to rapid changes in the ocean environment resulting from climate change and eutrophication is currently poorly understood. We investigated the response of a natural diatom-dominated assemblage in coastal California waters to interactions between the variables nitrogen source (nitrate and urea), temperature (19 and 23°C) and CO2 (380 and 800 ppm) in a factorial experimental matrix using continuous culture (ecostat) methods. The community included diatoms of the cosmopolitan genera Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, as well as Leptocylindrus and Cylindrotheca. Our results demonstrate strong interactive effects of these variables on community composition; notably, nitrogen source alone and nitrogen and CO2 together had a much greater influence on diatom community structure at 23°C compared with 19°C. In addition, warming and acidification interactions significantly increased cellular quotas of the neurotoxin domoic acid produced by Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. In general, the effects observed for the factors tested differed significantly between the various diatom genera in this assemblage, suggesting potentially divergent responses of some of these ecologically and biogeochemically important phytoplankton taxa to interactions between global-scale and local-scale anthropogenic stressors in a changing ocean." ;

    :description "As resource management and conservation efforts move toward multi-sector, ecosystem-based approaches, we need methods for comparing the varying responses of ecosystems to the impacts of human activities in order to prioritize management efforts, allocate limited resources, and understand cumulative effects. Given the number and variety of human activities affecting ecosystems, relatively few empirical studies are adequately comprehensive to inform these decisions. Consequently, management often turns to expert judgment for information. Drawing on methods from decision science, we offer a method for eliciting expert judgment to (1) quantitatively estimate the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, (2) help prioritize the management of stressors across multiple ecosystems, (3) evaluate how experts give weight to different criteria to characterize vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic stressors, and (4) identify key knowledge gaps. We applied this method to the California Current region in order to evaluate the relative vulnerability of 19 marine ecosystems to 53 stressors associated with human activities, based on surveys from 107 experts. When judging the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, we found that experts primarily considered two criteria: the ecosystem's resistance to the stressor and the number of species or trophic levels affected. Four intertidal ecosystems (mudflat, beach, salt marsh, and rocky intertidal) were judged most vulnerable to the suite of human activities evaluated here. The highest vulnerability rankings for coastal ecosystems were invasive species, ocean acidification, sea temperature change, sea level rise, and habitat alteration from coastal engineering, while offshore ecosystems were assessed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification, demersal destructive fishing, and shipwrecks. These results provide a quantitative, transparent, and repeatable assessment of relative vulnerability across ecosystems to any ongoing or emerging human activity. Combining these results with data on the spatial distribution and intensity of human activities provides a systematic foundation for ecosystem-based management.  " ;

    :description "Fossil fuel emissions are changing global temperature and ocean water chemistry. These changes are already altering the seasonal upwelling events that bring deeper ocean water with lower temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH to shallower areas of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. For example, increase absorption of CO2 by the ocean is expected to lower the pH of current upwelling events (observed to be ̃7.5) by a further 0.4 pH units. These changes in seawater chemistry are expected to affect reproduction, growth, and survival for many coastal marine invertebrates. To gain insights into this process, this study seeks to evaluate the effects of ocean acidification on the swimming behavior of sperm from the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), an economically and ecologically important species along the California coast. Abalone and many other marine organisms reproduce by releasing gametes into the ocean and fertilization success may be influenced by ocean conditions during this process. The effects of pH on sperm swimming behavior, which likely play an important role during fertilization, are unknown for red abalone. Thus, evaluating sperm motility under different pH conditions may reveal how fertilization could be affected by seawater chemistry. In this experiment, sperm were exposed to a pH of 8.0 and pH of 7.2 for one minute. Samples of sperm were recorded by video and analyzed using ImageJ ManualTracking software to measure speed. No significant difference in sperm speed was found between the high and low pH for this experiment. These findings will help gain insights into the effects of ocean acidification on the reproductive success of red abalone and other coastal marine invertebrates with similar reproductive modes." ;

    :description "We test for trace element proxies in the high-magnesium calcite fraction of bamboo coral internodes by comparing environmental conditions and growth rates to the specimen-mean compositions of 73 corals that were live-caught at depths ranging from 3 to 3950 m and collected from habitats ranging from tropical coral reefs to the Antarctic slope.Comparisons were done at a large geographic scale (LGS) and for a well sampled area south of Australia, across depths at a single site, in order to help separate the effects of environmental variables that co-vary at one spatial scale, but not the other.Thirty-seven trace elements were measured using solution-based Sector Field ICP-MS, of which seventeen were significantly detected in more than a third of the specimens.Only eight element/calcium ratios correlated significantly with any environmental variable at the large geographic scale, and only four did so at the local level.At the LGS, the highest correlation was between ambient temperature and Mg/Ca, which accounted for 89% of the variance across specimens, spanned all four Isidid sub-families and was independently significant in the two best sampled sub-families.The predictive (geometric mean) relationship is T(°C)=-23.9(±2.46)+0.34(±0.25)Mg/Ca(mmol/mol)T(°C)=-23.9(±2.46)+0.34(±0.25)Mg/Ca(mmol/mol) spanning a temperature range of -1.9 to 26.8 °C,Mg/Ca ratios from 58.6 to 155.1 mmol/mol, and an uncertainty (RMS) of 2.78 °C.The numbers in parentheses are 95% CIs.The slope of the regression does not differ significantly from that of abiotic high-Mg calcites, which suggests that the temperature-dependent incorporation of Mg into the carbonate results from kinetic reactions at the crystal surface.Analysis at the SH scale for the sub-set of specimens for which we had data suggests the ratio is also affected by growth rates.There were no obvious trace element correlates at either spatial scale of salinity, pH or oxygen levels that could not be accounted for by covariance between these environmental parameters and, in most cases, temperature.Single and multiple correlation analyses also confirm previous suggestions that Ba/Ca in bamboo coral calcite is a proxy for seawater barium and hence refractory nutrients, suggest that Sr/Ca is influenced by specimen-mean Mg/Ca ratios and water temperature as well as possibly seawater Sr/Ca, and falsify for bamboo corals P/Ca (as well as P/Cd and Cd/Ca) as a proxy for seawater phosphate levels.The predictive relationship between Isidid skeletal-mean Ba/Ca and seawater silicate concentrations appears to be linear, and is given by silicate($μ$molkg-1)=-56.7(±20.8)+9217(±1632)Ba/Ca(mmol/mol)silicate($μ$molkg-1)=-56.7(±20.8)+9217(±1632)Ba/Ca(mmol/mol) spanning a silicate range of 0.5 to 120 $μ$mol kg-1, a Ba/Ca range of 0.0042 to 0.0195 mmol/mol, and with an uncertainty (RMS) of 33.1 $μ$mol kg-1.Mn/Ca differences among specimens and sites are highly significant and appear to reflect seawater Mn, suggesting a proxy for this micronutrient.The compilation of growth rate data across 34 specimens indicates a wide range of growth rates even among con-familial specimens from within a single habitat, and suggests both ambient temperature and food availability underlie at least part of this variability." ;

Seabed maps are of potential use for all 3 sectors and consequently are a major activity within the project. With this in mind, SOPAC has acquired a Reson 8160 multibeam seabed mapping system. The system was installed on a charter vessel, and a marine survey of two islands of The Kingdom of Tonga, Tongatapu and Niuafo'ou was conducted separately. The survey of Tongatapu was conducted between the 13th November to the 7th December 2003, and Niuafo'ou Island was surveyed in transit to on the 29th and 30th January 2004." ;

Readings(height observations) recorded from the gauge, is held in this record and provided in the form of Yearly Reports, Tide Prediction Calendars and Hourly Sea Level and meteorological data (update frequency- real time) from the Nukualofa station. This is downloadable from the Distribution Info Section of this metadata record.The gauge has been returning high resolution, good scientific quality data since its installation. SEAFRAME gauges not only measure sea level by two independent means, but also a number of \"ancillary\" variables - air and water temperatures, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure. This is part of the AusAID-sponsored South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project (\"Pacific Project\") for the FORUM region, in response to concerns raised by its member countries over the potential impacts of an enhanced Greenhouse Effect on climate and sea levels in the South Pacific region. Project Implementation partners include Australian Bureau of Meteorology , National Tide Center, National Climate Center, Geoscience Australia and SPC ,SOPAC Division.To monitor changes in sea level and climate in the Pacific. The SPSLCMP project information is a unique detailed record of Tide predictions and Meteorological information from the different member Pacific Island countries. These information can be used for diverse purposes by boats, fishermen, government agencies, surveyors, planners, consulting scientists, environmental engineers and other individuals. These purposes include navigation purposes in shallow and narrow ports and intra-coastal waterways, improving fish catches , planning coastal rehabilitation, construction projects, recreation purposes such as catching big waves for surfers and a variety of other applications.Station Location: Tongatapu, Nukualofa, Latitude-21Â° 08' 25\" S, Longitude-175Â° 10' 45\" W, Height of Seaframe Sensor Bench Mark above Tide Gauge Zero (SSBM): 4.8464, Tide gauges measures relative sea level change, i.e., the change in sea level relative to the tide gauge, which is connected to the land.

The delimitation between the economic zone of the Republic of France around the territories of New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna and the exclusive economic zone of Fiji is based on the line of equidistance, with certain minor divergencies for administrative convenience. The line has been determined by using the nearest points of the baselines from which the territorial sea of each country is measured. In the case of France, the baseline is drawn in conformity with the Acts of 24th December 1971 and 28th December 1976. In the case of Fiji, the baseline is the archipelagic baseline drawn in accordance with the Fiji Marine Spaces Act of 15th December 1977.\r

We find that domain-wide pH and \\$\\\\\\backslashrm\\\\backslashOmega \\\\\\_\\\\backslashmathrm\\arag\\\\\\$ in the top 60 m of the water column decreased significantly over these three decades by about −0.02 decade−1 and −0.12 decade−1, respectively. In the nearshore areas of northern California and Oregon, ocean acidification is reconstructed to have progressed much more rapidly, with rates up to 30% higher than the domain-wide trends. Furthermore, ocean acidification penetrated substantially into the thermocline, causing a significant domain-wide shoaling of the aragonite saturation depth of on average −33 m decade−1 and up to −50 m decade−1 in the nearshore area of northern California. This resulted in a coast-wide increase in nearly undersaturated waters and the appearance of waters with \\$\\\\\\backslashrm\\\\backslashOmega \\\\\\_\\\\backslashmathrm\\arag\\\\\\backslashlt 1\\$, leading to a substantial reduction of habitat suitability.  Averaged over the whole domain, the main driver of these trends is the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. However, recent changes in the climatic forcing have substantially modulated these trends regionally. This is particularly evident in the nearshore regions, where the total trends in pH are up to 50% larger and trends in \\$\\\\\\backslashrm\\\\backslashOmega \\\\\\_\\\\backslashmathrm\\arag\\\\\\$ and in the aragonite saturation depth are even twice to three times larger than the purely atmospheric CO2-driven trends. This modulation in the nearshore regions is a result of the recent marked increase in alongshore wind stress, which brought elevated levels of dissolved inorganic carbon to the surface via upwelling. Our results demonstrate that changes in the climatic forcing need to be taken into consideration in future projections of the progression of ocean acidification in coastal upwelling regions. " ;

Probable decreases of pH would cause meaningful reduction of the sound absorption coefficient in near-surface ocean water for these frequencies. The results show that a few decibels of increase may occur in 100 years in some very quiet areas very far from noise sources, with small effects closer to noise sources. The use of ray physics allows sound energy attenuated via volume absorption and by the seafloor to be compared." ;

Egg capsules were collected from two locations in northern and central Chile, and then incubated throughout their entire intra-capsular life cycle at three nominal pCO2 levels, ∼400, 700 and 1000 ppm (i.e. corresponding to ∼8.0, 7.8 and 7.6 pH units, respectively). Hatched larvae were fed with natural food assemblages. Food availability at time zero did not vary significantly with pCO2 level. Our results clearly showed a significant effect of elevated pCO2 on the intensity of larval feeding, which dropped by \\textgreater60%. Incubation also showed that pCO2-driven ocean acidification (OA) may radically impact the selectivity of ingested food by C. concholepas larvae. Results also showed that larvae switched their clearance rate based on large cells, such as diatoms and dinoflagellates to tiny and highly abundant nanoflagellates and cyanobacteria as pCO2 levels increased. Thus, this study reveals the important effect of low pH conditions on larval feeding behavior, in terms of both ingestion magnitude and selectivity. These findings support the notion that larval feeding is a key physiological process susceptible to the effects of OA.  " ;

    :description "The Chilean Patagonia constitutes one of the most important and extensive fjord systems worldwide, therefore can be used as a natural laboratory to elucidate the pathway of both organic and inorganic matter in the receiving environment. In this study we use data collected during an intensive oceanographic cruise along the Magellan Strait into the Almirantazgo Fjord in southern Patagonia to evaluate how different sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and recycling may impact particulate organic carbon (POC) $δ$13C and influence the nutrients and carbonate system spatial distribution. The carbonate system presented large spatial heterogeneity. The lowest total alkalinity and DIC were associated to freshwater dilution observed near melting glaciers. The $δ$13CDIC analysis suggests that most DIC in the upper 50 m depth was not derived from terrestrial organic matter remineralization. 13C‐depleted riverine and ice‐melting DIC influence the DIC pool along the study area, but due to that DIC concentration from rivers and glaciers is relatively low, atmospheric carbon contribution or biological processes seem to be more relevant. Intense undersaturation of CO2 was observed in high chlorophyll waters. Respired DIC coming from the bottom waters seems to be almost insignificant for the inorganic carbon pool and therefore do not impact significantly the stable carbon isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon and POC in the upper 50 m depth. Considering the combined effect of cold and low alkalinity waters due to ice melting, our results highlight the importance of these processes in determining corrosive waters for CaCO3 and local acidification processes associated to calving glacier in fjord ecosystems.

    :description "We conducted a series of experiments to examine short-term (2-5 days) effects of abrupt increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in seawater on rates of primary and bacterial production at Station ALOHA (22°45' N, 158° W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). The majority of experiments (8 of 10 total) displayed no response in rates of primary production (measured by 14C-bicarbonate assimilation; 14C-PP) under elevated pCO2 (̃1100 $μ$atm) compared to ambient pCO2 (\\̃387 $μ$atm). In 2 of 10 experiments, rates of 14C-PP decreased significantly (\\~̃43%) under elevated pCO2 treatments relative to controls. Similarly, no significant differences between treatments were observed in 6 of 7 experiments where bacterial production was measured via incorporation of 3H-leucine (3H-Leu), while in 1 experiment, rates of 3H-Leu incorporation measured in the dark (3H-LeuDark) increased more than 2-fold under high pCO2 conditions. We also examined photoperiod-length, depth-dependent (0-125 m) responses in rates of 14C-PP and 3H-Leu incorporation to abrupt pCO2 increases (to \\~7̃50 $μ$atm). In the majority of these depth-resolved experiments (4 of 5 total), rates of 14C-PP demonstrated no consistent response to elevated pCO2. In 2 of 5 depth-resolved experiments, rates of 3H-LeuDark incorporation were lower (10% to 15%) under elevated pCO2 compared to controls. Our results revealed that rates of 14C-PP and bacterial production in this persistently oligotrophic habitat generally demonstrated no or weak responses to abrupt changes in pCO2. We postulate that any effects caused by changes in pCO2 may be masked or outweighed by the role that nutrient availability and temperature play in controlling metabolism in this ecosystem." ;

    :description "The resilience of tropical corals to ocean acidification depends on their ability to regulate the pH within their calcifying fluid (pHcf). Recent work suggests pHcf homeostasis under short-term exposure to pCO2 conditions predicted for 2100, but it is still unclear if pHcf homeostasis can be maintained throughout a corals lifetime. At CO2 seeps in Papua New Guinea, massive Porites corals have grown along a natural seawater pH gradient for decades. This natural gradient, ranging from pH 8.1-7.4, provides an ideal platform to determine corals' pHcf (using boron isotopes). Porites maintained a similar pHcf (̃8.24) at both a control (pH 8.1) and seep-influenced site (pH 7.9). Internal pHcf was slightly reduced (8.12) at seawater pH 7.6, and decreased to 7.94 at a site with a seawater pH of 7.4. A growth response model based on pHcf mirrors the observed distribution patterns of this species in the field. We suggest Porites has the capacity to acclimate after long-time exposure to end-of-century reduced seawater pH conditions and that strong control over pHcf represents a key mechanism to persist in future oceans. Only beyond end-of-century pCO2 conditions do they face their current physiological limit of pH homeostasis and pHcf begins to decrease." ;

    :description "A new, in-situ sensing system, Channelized Optical System (CHANOS), was recently developed to make high-resolution, simultaneous measurements of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH in seawater. Measurements made by this single, compact sensor can fully characterize the marine carbonate system. The system has a modular design to accommodate two independent, but similar measurement channels for DIC and pH. Both are based on spectrophotometric detection of hydrogen ion concentrations. The pH channel uses a flow-through, sample-indicator mixing design to achieve near instantaneous measurements. The DIC channel adapts a recently developed spectrophotometric method to achieve flow-through CO2 equilibration between an acidified sample and an indicator solution with a response time of only ̃90s. During laboratory and in-situ testing, CHANOS achieved a precision of ±0.0010 and ±2.5 µmol kg-1 for pH and DIC, respectively. In-situ comparison tests indicated that the accuracies of the pH and DIC channels over a three-week time-series deployment were ±0.0024 and ±4.1 µmol kg-1, respectively. This study demonstrates that CHANOS can make in-situ, climatology-quality measurements by measuring two desirable CO2 parameters, and is capable of resolving the CO2 system in dynamic marine environments." ;

Although many microalgae that are tolerant to high levels of CO2 have been found and evaluated, the CO2 concentration for their good growth is generally lower than their maximum tolerable CO2 level. In the present study, we attempted to isolate microalgae capable of growing in high levels of CO2 (high-level-CO2-preferring microalgae, HCP-microalgae). We used a CO2-permeable polystyrene bottle for the enrichment of HCP-microalgae in environmental samples. Two Picochlorum strains, Azisu1 and Azisu2, were isolated following enrichment of seawater. The strains showed fast growth in 20%–40% CO2 and contained high amount of some vitamins (B1, B6, and C), l-proline, and $γ$-aminobutyric acid. The C18 unsaturated and C16 saturated fatty acids were found dominant. In addition, astaxanthin was also found, but its cellular content was not high. Based on the previous reports on some Picochlorum sp. strains, it can be concluded that Azisu1 and Azisu2 may be promising candidates for commercial applications in nutraceutical, livestock, and aquaculture industries." ;

    :description "Long-term seawater pH records are essential for evaluating the rates of ocean acidification (OA) driven by anthropogenic emissions. Widespread, natural decadal variability in seawater pH superimposes on the long-term anthropogenic variations, likely influencing the OA rates estimated from the pH records. Here, we report a record of annual seawater pH estimated using the $δ$11B proxy over the past 159 years reconstructed from a Porites coral collected to the east of Hainan Island in the northern South China Sea (SCS). By coupling this time series with previously reported long-term seawater pH records in the West Pacific, the decadal variability in seawater pH records and its possible driving mechanisms were investigated. The results indicate that large decadal variability in seawater pH has occurred off eastern Hainan Island over the past 159 years, in agreement with previous records. The Qiongdong upwelling system, which controls nutrient supplies, regulates surface water productivity, and is driven by the East Asian summer monsoon, is the primary control of this decadal variability, while terrestrial inputs appear not influence significantly. Meanwhile the impacts of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) systems on seawater pH off eastern Hainan Island is likely limited. In contrast, the PDO is the main factor to influence the decadal seawater pH variability offshore the East Australia, while the mechanism controlling the decadal seawater pH variability in Guam is not clear yet. Meanwhile, The rate of decrease in seawater pH estimated from coral records are significantly different in different regions and over different time spans, which may reflect a combination of natural decadal variability in seawater pH and long-term variations. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms driving natural variability in seawater pH is important for improving estimates of ocean acidification rates driven by anthropogenic emissions.

    :description "Diseases threaten the structure and function of marine ecosystems and are contributing to the global decline of coral reefs. We currently lack an understanding of how climate change stressors, such as ocean acidification (OA) and warming, may simultaneously affect coral reef disease dynamics, particularly diseases threatening key reef-building organisms, for example crustose coralline algae (CCA). Here, we use coralline fungal disease (CFD), a previously described CCA disease from the Pacific, to examine these simultaneous effects using both field observations and experimental manipulations. We identify the associated fungus as belonging to the subphylum Ustilaginomycetes and show linear lesion expansion rates on individual hosts can reach 6.5 mm per day. Further, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that ocean-warming events could increase the frequency of CFD outbreaks on coral reefs, but that OA-induced lowering of pH may ameliorate outbreaks by slowing lesion expansion rates on individual hosts. Lowered pH may still reduce overall host survivorship, however, by reducing calcification and facilitating fungal bio-erosion. Such complex, interactive effects between simultaneous extrinsic environmental stressors on disease dynamics are important to consider if we are to accurately predict the response of coral reef communities to future climate change.

    :description "Coral reefs are under threat, exerted by a number of interacting effects inherent to the present climate change, including ocean acidification and global warming. Bioerosion drives reef degradation by recycling carbonate skeletal material and is an important but understudied factor in this context. Twelve different combinations of pCO2 and temperature were applied to elucidate the consequences of ocean acidification and global warming on the physiological response and bioerosion rates of the zooxanthellate sponge Cliona orientalis—one of the most abundant and effective bioeroders on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our results confirm a significant amplification of the sponges' bioerosion capacity with increasing pCO2, which is expressed by more carbonate being chemically dissolved by etching. The health of the sponges and their photosymbionts was not affected by changes in pCO2, in contrast to temperature, which had significant negative impacts at higher levels. However, we could not conclusively explain the relationship between temperature and bioerosion rates, which were slightly reduced at both colder as well as warmer temperatures than ambient. The present findings on the effects of ocean acidification on chemical bioerosion, however, will have significant implications for predicting future reef carbonate budgets, as sponges often contribute the lion's share of internal bioerosion on coral reefs." ;

    :description "Increasing global concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are predicted to decrease ocean pH, with potentially severe impacts on marine food webs, but empirical data documenting ocean pH over time are limited. In a high-resolution dataset spanning 8 years, pH at a north-temperate coastal site declined with increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and varied substantially in response to biological processes and physical conditions that fluctuate over multiple time scales. Applying a method to link environmental change to species dynamics via multispecies Markov chain models reveals strong links between in situ benthic species dynamics and variation in ocean pH, with calcareous species generally performing more poorly than noncalcareous species in years with low pH. The models project the long-term consequences of these dynamic changes, which predict substantial shifts in the species dominating the habitat as a consequence of both direct effects of reduced calcification and indirect effects arising from the web of species interactions. Our results indicate that pH decline is proceeding at a more rapid rate than previously predicted in some areas, and that this decline has ecological consequences for near shore benthic ecosystems." ;

Under elevated CO2, the alga showed a significant reduction in meiospore germination, fecundity, and reproductive success. Larger female and male gametophytes were noted to occur under high CO2 conditions and high light magnified these positive effects. Under conditions of low light combined with high PCO2, the differentiation of gametophytes was delayed until the end of the experiment. By contrast, gametophytes were able to survive after having been subjected to a long-term acclimation period, of 105 days. Although the elevated PCO2 resulted in a significant increase in sporophyte length, the biomass abundance (expressed as individual density attached to the seed fiber) was reduced significantly. Further stress resistance experiments showed that, although the acidified samples had lower resistance to high light and high temperature conditions, they displayed higher acclimation to CO2-saturated seawater conditions compared with the control groups. These combined results indicate that OA has a severe negative effect on S. japonica, which may result in future shifts in species dominance and community structure. " ;

Surface water $Ømega$arag ranged from 2.0–3.8, whereas subsurface water $Ømega$arag was generally lower than 2.0. Temperature changes had a strong influence on $Ømega$arag through induced CO2 solubility changes in seawater. Riverine freshwater input decreased $Ømega$arag in the Changjiang and Yalu river estuaries, but induced higher $Ømega$arag in the Yellow River estuary. Biological processes had opposite effects on $Ømega$arag, whereby elevated biological production led to the highest $Ømega$arag in the South Yellow Sea surface water, whereas net community respiration/remineralization induced low $Ømega$arag in subsurface water. Stratification affected the level and scale of low $Ømega$arag in subsurface water. By the year 2100, surface water with $Ømega$arag \\textgreater 2.0 will disappear except for the Yellow River estuary, and most of the subsurface water will develop substantial aragonite undersaturation." ;

    :description "Using the results from the NCAR CSM1.4-coupled global carbon cycle–climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios SRES A2 and B1, we estimated the effects of both global warming and ocean acidification on the future habitats of corals in the seas around Japan during this century. As shown by Yara et al. (Biogeosciences 9:4955–4968, 2012), under the high-CO2-emission scenario (SRES A2), coral habitats will be sandwiched and narrowed between the northern region, where the saturation state of the carbonate mineral aragonite ($Ømega$arag) decreases, and the southern region, where coral bleaching occurs. We found that under the low-emission scenario SRES B1, the coral habitats will also shrink in the northern region by the reduced $Ømega$arag but to a lesser extent than under SRES A2, and in contrast to SRES A2, no bleaching will occur in the southern region. Therefore, coral habitats in the southern region are expected to be largely unaffected by ocean acidification or surface warming under the low-emission scenario. Our results show that potential future coral habitats depend strongly on CO2 emissions and emphasize the importance of reducing CO2 emissions to prevent negative impacts on coral habitats." ;

    :description "The severity of the impact of elevated atmospheric pCO2 to coral reef ecosystems depends, in part, on how seawater pCO2 affects the balance between calcification and dissolution of carbonate sediments. Presently, there are insufficient published data that relate concentrations of pCO2 and CO32− to in situ rates of reef calcification in natural settings to accurately predict the impact of elevated atmospheric pCO2 on calcification and dissolution processes. Rates of net calcification and dissolution, CO32− concentrations, and pCO2 were measured, in situ, on patch reefs, bare sand, and coral rubble on the Molokai reef flat in Hawaii. Rates of calcification ranged from 0.03 to 2.30 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 and dissolution ranged from –0.05 to –3.3 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1. Calcification and dissolution varied diurnally with net calcification primarily occurring during the day and net dissolution occurring at night. These data were used to calculate threshold values for pCO2 and CO32− at which rates of calcification and dissolution are equivalent. Results indicate that calcification and dissolution are linearly correlated with both CO32− and pCO2. Threshold pCO2 and CO32− values for individual substrate types showed considerable variation. The average pCO2 threshold value for all substrate types was 654±195 $μ$atm and ranged from 467 to 1003 $μ$atm. The average CO32− threshold value was 152±24 $μ$mol kg−1, ranging from 113 to 184 $μ$mol kg−1. Ambient seawater measurements of pCO2 and CO32− indicate that CO32− and pCO2 threshold values for all substrate types were both exceeded, simultaneously, 13% of the time at present day atmospheric pCO2 concentrations. It is predicted that atmospheric pCO2 will exceed the average pCO2 threshold value for calcification and dissolution on the Molokai reef flat by the year 2100. " ;

    :description "Shells of brachiopods are excellent archives for environmental reconstructions in the recent and distant past as their microstructure and geochemistry respond to climate and environmental forcings. We studied the morphology and size of the basic structural unit, the secondary layer fibre, of the shells of several extant brachiopod taxa to derive a model correlating microstructural patterns to environmental conditions. Twenty-one adult specimens of six recent brachiopod species adapted to different environmental conditions, from Antarctica, to New Zealand, to the Mediterranean Sea, were chosen for microstructural analysis using SEM, TEM and EBSD. We conclude that: 1) there is no significant difference in the shape and size of the fibres between ventral and dorsal valves, 2) there is an ontogenetic trend in the shape and size of the fibres, as they become larger, wider, and flatter with increasing age. This indicates that the fibrous layer produced in the later stages of growth, which is recommended by the literature to be the best material for geochemical analyses, has a different morphostructure and probably a lower organic content than that produced earlier in life. In two species of the same genus living in seawater with different temperature and carbonate saturation state, a relationship emerged between the microstructure and environmental conditions. Fibres of the polar Liothyrella uva tend to be smaller, rounder and less convex than those of the temperate Liothyrella neozelanica, suggesting a relationship between microstructural size, shell organic matter content, ambient seawater temperature and calcite saturation state." ;

    :description "Increasing CO2 in seawater (i.e. ocean acidification) may have various and potentially adverse effects on phytoplankton dynamics and hence the organic carbon dynamics. We conducted a CO2 manipulation experiment in the Sea of Okhotsk in summer 2006 to investigate the response of the organic carbon dynamics. During the 14-day incubation of nutrient depleted and 200 $μ$atm in situ pCO2 surface water with a natural plankton assemblage under 150, 280, 480, and 590 $μ$atm pCO2, the amount of net dissolved organic carbon accumulation was significantly lower at N480 $μ$atm pCO2 than at 150 $μ$atm pCO2, while differences in net particulate organic carbon accumulation between the treatments were small and did not show a clear relationship with the pCO2. This is the first report to show a decreased net organic carbon production of natural plankton community under elevated pCO2. Phytoplankton pigment analysis suggests that the relative contribution of fucoxanthin-containing phytoplankton such as diatoms to the phytoplankton biomass was lower at N 280 $μ$atm pCO2 than at 150 $μ$atm pCO2. Different pCO2 conditions may alter the organic carbond ynamics through changes in plankton processes. We conclude that the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 in a time scale from the last half century to the end of this century has potential to affect the carbon cycle in nutrient depleted subpolar surface waters." ;

    :description "It has been suggested that climate change may promote the outbreaks of diseases in the sea through altering the host susceptibility, the pathogen virulence, and the host-pathogen interaction. However, the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on the pathogen components of bacterial community and the host-pathogen interaction of marine bivalves are still poorly understood. Therefore, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and host-pathogen interaction analysis between blood clam (Tegillarca granosa) and Vibrio harveyi were conducted in the present study to gain a better understanding of the ecological impacts of ocean acidification. The results obtained revealed a significant impact of ocean acidification on the composition of microbial community at laboratory scale. Notably, the abundance of Vibrio, a major group of pathogens to many marine organisms, was significantly increased under ocean acidification condition. In addition, the survival rate and haemolytic activity of V. harveyi were significantly higher in the presence of haemolymph of OA treated T. granosa, indicating a compromised immunity of the clam and enhanced virulence of V. harveyi under future ocean acidification scenarios. Conclusively, the results obtained in this study suggest that future ocean acidification may increase the risk of Vibrio pathogen infection for marine bivalve species, such as blood clams." ;

    :description "Marine acidification will be an important environmental problem in the near future as a result of persistent emissions of CO2 and dissolution into seawater. In this study, we found that calcification and respiration of the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) are likely to be severely affected by increasing acidification. Calcification and respiration significantly declined as pH decreased. The calcification rate decreased by 33% when the pH of water was 7.9 compared with a pH of 8.1, and decreased close to 0 when the pH was reduced to 7.3. CO2 and O2 respiratory rates were reduced by 14% and 11%, respectively, when pH decreased from 7.9 to 7.3. Increasing acidification also led to changes in the metabolic pathways of C. farreri. Under acidic conditions, proteins may replace carbohydrates as the metabolic substrate. The survival of C. farreri is likely to be severely threatened in the next few centuries. " ;

    :description "The 3-day diurnal dynamics of carbonate system and related parameters on Luhuitou fringing reef of Sanya Bay-adjacent to the South China Sea (SCS) were observed in December of 2009 (early winter), April (spring), July (summer) and November (late-autumn) of 2010. The Luhuitou fringing reef ecosystem was generally dominated by macro and planktonic algae throughout the year except by coralline algae in winter. The system parameters showed distinct diurnal trends in the four seasons. Averaged ranges of diurnal variation for dissolved oxygen and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were higher in the autumn, 4.67 mg L−1 and 218.2 $μ$atm, respectively than other seasons. Averaged ranges of diurnal variation for normalized total alkalinity (NTA) was higher in the winter (61.3 $μ$mol kg−1), and lower in the spring (16.0 $μ$mol kg−1). The diurnal variations are mainly controlled by biological activities, especially by the processes of photosynthesis and respiration in the reef ecosystem. In winter, however, calcification and dissolution contributed more to the diurnal variations, compared with the other three seasons. Total alkalinity was largely related to seasonal changes in river inflow rates. Dissolved oxygen, pH, total CO2 and aragonite saturation also showed seasonal variations. These variations were mainly controlled by the seasonal changes of photosynthesis and respiration, which were mainly affected by changes in benthic community structure, temperature and river inflow rates. The oversaturated pCO2 in the reef ecosystem with respect to the atmosphere in the winter and summer resulted in CO2 discharge from the reef ecosystem to the SCS. The whole system served as net source of CO2 to the atmosphere and the adjacent South China Sea on an annual time scale.  " ;

    :description "Based on six cruises from March to September in 2016, we investigated monthly distributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ancillary water chemistry parameters in a mariculture area in the Northern Yellow Sea, where summertime hypoxia and seawater acidification were observed. The most severe oxygen depletion (hypoxia covered approximately one-third of the aquaculture area) and the largest pH decrease (8.07 ± 0.05 in surface layer vs. 7.66 ± 0.07 in bottom layer) were revealed in August. Concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the absorption properties of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) were used to characterize DOM. Results showed that DOM mainly originated from marine in situ processes. In March, a DOM pool with the lowest DOC concentration of 211 ± 23 $μ$mol L−1 and nearly uniform optical characteristics were presented in the well-mixed water column. In August, however, DOC increased to 361 ± 29 $μ$mol L−1 in the surface layer and 342 ± 25 $μ$mol L−1 in the bottom layer. Two non-linear relationships between the absorption coefficient at 355 nm [aCDOM(355)] and the absorption spectral slope over 275–295 nm (S275−295) were revealed. According to modeling results, the non-linear relationships were mostly caused by the conservative mixing of a refractory CDOM pool with a freshly produced CDOM pool. Apparent oxygen utilization in August was positively related to DOC, but not to aCDOM(355) and S275−295, presumably due to multiple sources of CDOM in bottom waters. Both aCDOM(355) and S275−295 respond largely to decreasing pH; however, they would be less affected by ocean acidification since this process leads to a limited pH decline." ;

    :description "Ocean acidification and warming are predicted to affect the ability of marine bivalves to build their shells, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Shell formation is an extremely complex process requiring a detailed understanding of biomineralization processes. Sodium incorporation into the shells would increase if bivalves rely on the exchange of Na+/H+ to maintain homeostasis for shell formation, thereby shedding new light on the acid-base and ionic regulation at the calcifying front. Here, we investigated the combined effects of seawater pH (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) and temperature (16 and 22 °C) on the growth and sodium composition of the shells of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis. Exposure of M. edulis to low pH (7.7 and 7.4) caused a significant decrease of shell formation, whereas a 6 °C warming significantly depressed the rate of shell growth in P. yessoensis. On the other hand, while the amount of Na incorporated into the shells of P. yessoensis did not increase in acidified seawater, an increase of Na/Cashell with decreasing pH was observed in M. edulis, the latter agreeing well with the aforementioned hypothesis. Moreover, a combined analysis of the shell growth and sodium content provides a more detailed understanding of shell formation processes. Under acidified conditions, mussels may maintain more alkaline conditions favorable for calcification, but a significant decrease of shell formation indicates that the mineralization processes are impaired. The opposite occurs in scallops; virtually unaffected shell growth implies that shell mineralization functions well. Finding of the present study may pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on bivalve shell formation." ;

    :description "Due to the elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, ocean acidification (OA) has recently emerged as a research theme in marine biology due to an expected deleterious effect of altered seawater chemistry on calcification. A system simulating future OA scenario is crucial for OA-related studies. Here, we designed an OA-simulated system (OASys) with three solenoid-controlled CO2 gas channels. The OASys can adjust the pH of the seawater by bubbling CO2 gas into seawaters via feedback systems. The OASys is very simple in structure with an integrated design and is new-user friendly with the instruction. Moreover, the OASys can monitor and record real-time pH values and can maintain pH levels within 0.02 pH unit. In a 15-d experiment, the OASys was applied to simulate OA in which the expected target pH values were 8.00, 7.80 and 7.60 to study the calcifying response of Galaxea fascicularis. The results showed daily mean seawater pH values held at pH 8.00±0.01, 7.80±0.01 and 7.61±0.01 over 15 d. Correspondingly, the coral calcification of G. fascicularis gradually decreased with reduced pH." ;

Our results showed that the calcification rate (0.17 ± 0.04%/day to 0.21 ± 0.12%/day) in P. damicornis remained unchanged in the acidified seawaters, but that in S. caliendrum decreased significantly (0.62 ± 0.21%/day to 0.44 ± 0.11%/day). Our results suggested that reef corals with high calcification rates may be more susceptible to the enhanced dissolution of CO2. Differential calcified response to elevated CO2 may be closely attributed to coralline capacity of the upregulation at their site of calcification in acidified seawater." ;

Aeration with CO2-enriched air reduced the pH in the culture medium in comparison with aeration with air. The mean relative growth rate was enhanced when H. fusiforme was grown at high CO2 with respect to normal CO2. There was little change in the rate of light-saturated photosynthesis, dark respiratory rate and apparent photosynthetic efficiency, measured in natural seawater, between thalli grown in high and normal CO2  contents. However, both the mean nitrate uptake rate and the activity of nitrate reductase at light period were increased following culture at high CO2, indicating an enhanced nitrogen assimilation of H. fusiforme thalli with the CO2  enrichment in culture. It was proposed that the intensive cultivation of H. fusiforme would remove nutrients more efficiently with the future elevation of CO2 levels in seawater, which could be a possible solution to the problem of ongoing coastal eutrophication." ;
