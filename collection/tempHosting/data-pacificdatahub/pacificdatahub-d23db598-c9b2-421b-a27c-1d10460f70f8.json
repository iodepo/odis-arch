    "description": "The Maritime Zones Act (MZA) 2018 for Cooks Islands repeals the Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977, (Act No. 16 of 14 November 1977). It states that the exclusive economic zone comprises of those areas of the sea, seabed, and subsoil that are beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea having, as their outer limits, a line measured seaward from the territorial sea baseline, every point of which is distant 200 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.\r\n\r\nThe Maritime Zones (Exclusive Economic Zone Outer Limits) Regulations 2021, in accordance with MZA 2018, prescribes lines generated by reference to points with geographical coordinates that defines Cook Islands EEZ. Furthermore, the point has (i) a treaty reference point, which is a reference to how the point is referred to in a treaty (ii) a provisional status (P) which subject to final delimitation, an interim point creating a provisional median line has been used without prejudice to any future delimitation (iii) 200 nautical mile, where the exclusive economic zone is adjacent to the high seas. In this regulation, points defined by geographic coordinates are determined by reference to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The regulation contains charts as a general illustration of the lines specified within it. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/03MaritimeZonesEEZOLRegs2021Rev.pdf\r\nhttps://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/Maritime%20Zones%20Act%202018.pdf\r\n\r\n",
