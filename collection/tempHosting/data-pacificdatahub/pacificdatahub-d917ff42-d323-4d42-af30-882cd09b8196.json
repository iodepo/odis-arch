    "description": "Pamela, 13, is a dynamic adolescent, head girl and an active participant in one of Equal Playing Field school action groups in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea’s capital. \r\nShe was in Fiji; caught in transit between Papua New Guinea and Samoa due to changes in her connecting flight on her way to attend “A dive into the Blue Pacific” side event at the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) earlier this month.\r\nPamela was to give a voice to Pacific adolescent girls on behalf of Equal Playing Field, supported through the Pacific Girl program that is managed by the Australian Government’s Pacific Women program. Fortunately, her Pacific Girl colleague ‘Anamalia Falemaka of the Talitha Project (Tonga) was able to attend the event.\r\nIn lieu of a Samoan stage, Pamela shared her personal reflections on issues faced by young girls in Papua New Guinea with the Pacific Women Support Unit in this video:\r\nShe highlights child abuse, corporal punishment, child molestation, child marriage, child neglect and bullying. She also shared the focus of Equal Playing Field’s work.",
