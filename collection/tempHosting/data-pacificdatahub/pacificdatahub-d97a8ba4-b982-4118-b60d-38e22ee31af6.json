    "description": "This short policy brief states women’s empowerment is important because:\n\n- Women’s empowerment contributes to economic growth. \n\n- Marginalisation of women in Pacific island labour markets reduces the labour ‘talent pool’. \n\n- The high level of violence against women is a major barrier to development. \n\nIt suggests a number of actions that can be taken: \n\n- Temporary Special Measures to raise women’s political participation can increase women in decision making which can result in broad gains in women’s empowerment. \n\n- Gender mainstreaming has had limited impact and needs to be further evaluated to identify constraints to progress.   \n\n- Highlighting the costs of gender inequality can help build the political will to address it.  The brief then includes data and arguments for improving women’s empowerment in the region.",
