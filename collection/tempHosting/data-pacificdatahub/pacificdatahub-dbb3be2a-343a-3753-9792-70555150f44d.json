    "description": "This record holds the Bathymetry chart of Havannah Bay showing shallow to deep, from red to blue, with two times vertical exaggeration. Chart is the result of the high-resolution bathymetric mapping survey of the seabed surrounding Port Havannah Harbour in Vanuatu. This bathymetric map is a blend of multibeam (MBES), and singlebeam (SBES) echosounder data. This work was initiated by the SOPAC/EU Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.\nReport and dataset is available as a separate metadata record.To give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features, and serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.All slope angles exceeding 60 degrees (degrees from horizontal) were interpreted as scarps. Any Inclined area of the seafloor that was laterally confined by distinctive slopes, with or without an upslope headscarp, was interpreted as a channel. Port Havannah Harbour Bathymetry Chart provides more information on slope angle and shaded relief maps.",
