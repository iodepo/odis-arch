    "description": "Designed for and by girls, Pacific Girl is the only regional program in the Pacific dedicated to adolescent girls and advancing their rights and opportunities.\r\nThis video provides an overview of the Pacific Girl Highlights booklet, the program's first publication. The booklet reflects on the first three years of the Pacific Girl program – its inception, context, implementation and learning. The highlights are drawn from program analysis, with sections on what works to engage adolescent girls in the Pacific as well as what the program is achieving through each of its five outcomes. The booklet also includes “herstory” profiles of young women and girls who have participated in Pacific Girl partner projects and are taking up the challenge to build a better world by leading and directing their programs as mentors and facilitators in their communities.",
