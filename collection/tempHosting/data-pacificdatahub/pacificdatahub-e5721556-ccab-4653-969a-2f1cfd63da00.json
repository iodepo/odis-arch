    "description": "The fourth Pacific Women in Papua New Guinea Annual Learning Workshop provided an update on activities, research, innovation, and good practice undertaken by Pacific Women and its partners in 2017-2018 in the areas of: \n\n- Increasing womenâ€™s leadership and decision making. \n\n- Increasing economic opportunities for women. \n\n- Reducing violence against women and expanding support services. \n\nWorkshop participants presented research findings, outcomes from their projects and facilitated mini skills building workshops to share tools and approaches that work in their various projects. Throughout the workshop, participants were able to expand their networks, develop their skills, and engage in meaningful discussion with people who are contributing to gender equality and the empowerment of women in Papua New Guinea. \n\nHighlights of the 2018 workshop were the variety of useful and practical sessions; the active engagement of the Assembly of Disabled Persons as presenters, participants and interpreters; and the engagement of the Sanap Wantaim Youth Group. The youth advocates facilitated sessions, led daily energisers and performed at the evening networking events.",
