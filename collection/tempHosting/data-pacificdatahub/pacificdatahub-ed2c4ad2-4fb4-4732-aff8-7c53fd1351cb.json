    "description": "The purpose of this policy is to provide a framework that will ensure and strengthen access to quality education for all persons with disabilities in all schools throughout Fiji. Quality education reflects the spirit of equity, inclusion, access, progress and achievement of educational outcomes that will guide and direct the journey of one’s lifelong learning and the opportunity to enjoy one’s quality of life. While all children should be given the opportunity to learn together wherever possible in mainstream schools close to their homes regardless of difficulties, disabilities or differences, it is recognised that for some students, Special Schools are an important option. This policy will reflect on the rights of persons with disabilities according to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.",
