In 2004, the post of coordinator for the Tuvalu National Council of Women caught her eye. She applied and has been in the role since.\nShe shared this video message from the inaugural Tuvalu National Women and Youth Forum, held from 9–13 December. The forum focused on many issues: ending violence against women and girls; advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights; and increasing women’s participation in leadership and ‘Falekaupule’ decision making roles.",
