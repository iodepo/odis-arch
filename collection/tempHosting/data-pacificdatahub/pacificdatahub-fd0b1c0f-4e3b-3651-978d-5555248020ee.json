    "description": "High-resolution bathymetric mapping survey was carried out for Kiribati Islands around Abaiang, Tarawa, Abemama, Banaba and Onotoa. The survey was carried out over a period of six weeks in September and October 2005, resulting in the acquisition of over 900 km of multibeam echo sounder (MBES) data. \nResultant data compilation was used to produce bathymetry charts of Banaba at a scale of 1 :15 000 and is available for download from its appropriate link under Distribution Info.\nThis work was initiated by the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the European Union (EU) Reducing Vulnerability of Pacific ACP States Project.Bathymetry maps/ charts should provide information about water depths around the islands. These new bathymetric maps should also  give a descriptive picture of the ocean bottom terrain, vividly revealing the size, shape and distribution of underwater features. They can serve as the basic tool for scientific, engineering, marine geophysical and environmental studies, as well as marine and coastal resource management.Banaba located on 0 degrees 51' 34\"S and 169 degrees 32' 13\"E on the west of Kiribati, at 6 square kilometers (2.3 square miles) is a raised coral island. Multibeam surveyed area extends approximately 2 km offshore on all sides of the island and covered a maximum depth coverage of 1700m.Refer to Kiribati Technical Report: High Resolution bathymetry survey of Kiribati.",
