    "description": "The global process under way to develop a new international development framework after the Millennium Development Goals expire in 2015 provides an opportunity to address the lack of power that women have to influence decision making compared to men. To be successful the framework needs to take into account the obstacles to gender equality; how and why these are being perpetuated; and evidence of measures that have proved successful in addressing them.  \n\nThis summary document provides information to influence priorities post-2015 by discussing: \n\n- Why women’s participation and influence matters. \n\n- Barriers to and enablers of women’s participation and influence. \n\n- The goal, target and indicators needed to increase participation and influence. \n\n- Integration and data collection.",
