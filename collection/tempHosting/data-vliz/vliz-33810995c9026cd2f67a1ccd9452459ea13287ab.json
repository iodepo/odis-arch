    "description": "The diversity and spread of several types of vegetation have been monitored by vegetation mappings. These mappings are done by both classic methods and remote sensing techniques. Classic methods use false colour IR aerial images to distinguish vegetation units, which receive a specific type based on the physiognomic system of dominant structural and species-related features. Remote sensing techniques use hyperspectral images. Here, a classification is made based on the properties of the pixels, which results in a typology to which different vegetation types can be connected. This connection is aided by collected ground data. The overhead flights are preferably done in August or September.",
