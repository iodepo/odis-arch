    "description": "In the Sea Scheldt and tributaries the profiles of 28 mud flat and salt marsh zones are measured annually on lines perpendicular to the shore. For each profile detailed measurements are made with sedimentation erosion plots as well (reference pole with 16 measurements around it) to statistically detect changes to profiles too. The measurements take place from the toe of the dyke to the low water line. While being measured the profiles are described on morphodynamic features and documented on fixed points with photographs. Granulometry is also determined for microdynamics on those lines.",
