    "description": "In this project, companies Seaweed Harvest Nordsea, AtSeaNova, Murre Technologies and GEOxyz want to significantly increase the production of seaweed. The seaweed collective Stichting Noordzeeboerderij and knowledge institutions Ugent and HZ University of Applied Science will support them in this. The partners will jointly develop a large-scale and automated seaweed cultivation system that is reliable at sea and that can be deployed within the many wind farms in the North Sea. The project thus contributes to the multiple use of space of the wind farms.",
