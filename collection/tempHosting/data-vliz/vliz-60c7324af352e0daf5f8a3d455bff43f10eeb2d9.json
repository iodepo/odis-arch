    "description": "The maximum extraction depth for the exploration of sand and gravel in the Belgian sea areas was established by Ministerial Decree on 28 September 2020. On the basis of this new reference level, subzones within the control zones are delineated where this level has globally been reached or exceeded. These will be closed for exploitation as of 1 January 2022. Each year, these zones will be re-evaluated and, if necessary, adjusted.\nThe area THBREF has been closed for exploitation since 1 October 2010 and serves as a reference area for biological monitoring. \nSectors 3a and 3b are alternately open for exploitation. Currently, sector 3b is used as an unloading quay. This will remain the case until the area has become too shallow for dredgers who are used for maintenance dredging or until another economic or ecological criterion encourages the government to relocate this quay. \n\nSource: FPS Economy",
