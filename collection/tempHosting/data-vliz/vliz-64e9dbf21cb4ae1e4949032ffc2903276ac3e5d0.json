    "description": "This map shows the locations where measurements will be performed within the CREST project (Climate Resilient Coast). Different types of measurements will be carried out.\n* In Zeebrugge wave overtopping will be monitored.\n* Climatic parameters are collected in Ostend.\n* At Groenendijk-West and Mariakerke the amount of sand that is displaced under the influence of the wind will be measured.\n* In addition to these aeolian measurements, several parameters are measured in Mariakerke by means of buoys, and there is an Argus system operational. Every 30 minutes a photo is taken from the beach that can be used in the determination of the coastline, bathymetry and wave and current characteristics.",
