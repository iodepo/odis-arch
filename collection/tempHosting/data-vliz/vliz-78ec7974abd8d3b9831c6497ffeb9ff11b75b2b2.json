    "description": "What is the Bras d’Or Lake Biosphere Reserve?\n\nIt is a UNESCO designated area defined by the watershed of the Bras d'Or lake. It is Canada's 16th biosphere.\n\nBiosphere reserves are special places around the world where people are trying to live more sustainably – that means 4 things:\n\na healthy environment\na healthy economy\na healthy society\na healthy culture\nThe Bras d'Or Lake Biosphere Reserve Association is a group of volunteers who have worked to have the Bras d’Or Lake and its watershed designated as a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve. We now oversee the activities of the Biosphere Reserve. We are a registered society in the province of Nova Scotia.\n532 Chebucto St.\nP.O.
