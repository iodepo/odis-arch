    "description": "The basin of the Scheldt has an area of 21,860 km2 and is bordered by the North Sea, by a number of coastal basins north of the Seine and the Meuse and IJzer basin. The natural boundary of the basin on land is created by the topography of the area: the differences in elevation of the soil determine how and to which basin the water runs off and give it the boundary of the basin",
