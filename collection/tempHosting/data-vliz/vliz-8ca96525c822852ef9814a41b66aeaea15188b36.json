    "description": "The Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60 / EC) stipulates that all European surface waters must be at least in a good ecological state (natural waters) or have a good ecological potential (highly modified or artificial waters) by 2015. The main objective of the Long-Term Vision 2030 of the Scheldt Estuary was to obtain a healthy estuarine ecosystem in which water quality is no longer the limiting factor. The ecological condition / potential indicates the evolution, whether or not the European objective is achieved, which is further juridically mentioned in the Water Act in the Netherlands and the Decree on Integrated Water Policy (DIW) in Flanders.",
