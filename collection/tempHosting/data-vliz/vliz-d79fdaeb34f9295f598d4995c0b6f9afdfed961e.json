    "description": "The demarcation of a household is based on the number of registrations at the same principal place of residence in the National Register. The figures relate to the legal situation and may differ from the actual situation. Households are divided into private and collective households. Collective households are: religious communities, retirement homes, orphanages, student and worker houses, hospitals and prisons (Statbel provision). All households that are not collective are private households.
