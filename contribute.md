# Contributing

## Intro

OIH is an open source project, contributors are welcome.  Feel free to submit 
pull requests or reach out to the ODIS community to more formally join the community.

## Branching patterns

The __schema-dev__ branch is the main development branch that we merge into __master__.  
Branch __schema-dev__ into __schema-dev-XX__ where XX is your initials.  If duplicate simply
add to the XX as needed to arrive at a unique branch.  

Do pull requests from your __schema-dev-XX__ into __schema-dev__ and assign reviewers. 
We will then merge into __master__ as needed.  Do not make commits to __mastger__ or  into 
__gh_pages__ as the later is a build target for Jupyter Book GitHub Actions.
