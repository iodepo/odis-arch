# OIH Graph for Data Questions

## About

This section links to a couple of notebooks that describe some approaches
to building products (OIH Graph Pre-processer) and extracting entities
(NLP GPE notebook).

This is really just the very start of trying to work with the OIH graph 
as a resource to answer questions.   This is also part of the bigger concept
of the OIH as a platform for such actions.  While search and discovery is 
important, there is much more we can do with the graph and we need to 
provide some examples of that to help drive engagement with the graph in that
manner.
