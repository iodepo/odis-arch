# Personas

A persona is a fictional representation of a typical user of a product or service. Personas are created by gathering data about real users, such as their demographics, goals, and needs. They are then used to help designers and developers understand the needs of their users and create products that meet those needs.

## Patrica Planner

A number of countries around the world are engaged in a process of developing spatial plans for usage of their EEZs (ref 1). There are a number of names for this process, but the popular one is currently Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). Itâ€™s like land use planning, but for the sea, taking into account various stakeholder uses of the ocean, as well as natural ecosystems/ processes.

According to UNESCO, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area of the sea that extends up to 200 nautical miles beyond a nation's territorial sea. Within this zone, a coastal nation has jurisdiction over both living and non-living resources. The EEZ includes the water column, while the continental shelf includes only the seabed and subsoil.

IOC/UNESCO runs a global MSP project, but national efforts are all independent. OIH could be a very useful tool for practitioners / country reps to find relevant data from their waters.

### Goals:

* To develop a spatial plan for the use of a country's EEZ that is sustainable and meets the needs of all stakeholders.
* To balance the needs of different users of the ocean, such as fishing, shipping, and tourism.
* To protect marine ecosystems and habitats.
* To ensure the long-term sustainability of ocean resources.

### Pain Points:

* Lack of data on ocean resources and uses.
* Fragmentation of decision-making authority among different government agencies.
* Lack of public participation in the planning process.
* Lack of funding for MSP.

### Needs:

* Access to reliable and up-to-date data on ocean resources and uses.
* A coordinated approach to decision-making among government agencies.
* Increased public participation in the planning process.
* Increased funding for MSP.
