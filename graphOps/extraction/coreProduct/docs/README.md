# README.md

This is just some notes right now about the three flows. 
At this time they are all in one complex image, these will be split out 
into one for each of:

* advocateFlow:  The interaction in person with the partners

* analysisFlow:  The flow to products for the analusis, this is the "State of the Ocean Data Flow"

* interopFlow:   The flow to products or services to interact with other groups

## Notes

* with the concept of exposing the triplestore via SPARQL and GraphQL it would be 
  good to chat with the CODATA re: CDIF approaches and also look at what DataCite is doing
 at https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-graphql-api-guide and also https://commons.datacite.org/ 
* commons.oceaninfohub.org for the services, resources etc to better talk to developers, or better just do this in the book.
