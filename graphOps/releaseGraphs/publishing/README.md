# Publishing

## About

The code here will be used to generate and publish the release graphs.
We will use the sandbox environment available at http://sandbox.zenodo.org.

Note that the sandbox environment can be cleaned at anytime. Also, the 
sandbox environment will issue test DOIs using the 10.5072 prefix 
instead of Zenodoâ€™s normal prefix (10.5281).

## Card

It would be good to generate a metadata card for each release.
This will likely be done using schema.org or the descriptive information, 
however it would be good to look over VoID (https://www.w3.org/TR/void/)
to see if there are some good properties in there to use.
