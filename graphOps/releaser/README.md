It should do this as a snapshot set, make a prefix like:





### DEPRECTATED   the following is no longer the patter, date the prefix, not the object
For the latest *_release.nq
```bash
public/graphs/odisgraph_v1_[DATE]
```
and

For the latest *_prov.nq
```bash
public/graphs/odisgraph_v1_prov_[DATE]
```
