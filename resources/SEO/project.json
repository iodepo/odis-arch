  "description": "The Ocean InfoHub Project supports a global network of distributed information and data resources related to the ocean. The project facilitates discovery and interoperability of existing information systems through the lightweight Ocean Data and Information System (ODIS) architecture. This enables users from Member States and other partners to discover and more easily access global oceans information, data and knowledge products for management and sustainable development. The Project has had a focus on co-design with three pilot regions in particular: Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDs), to meet their unique user community (thematic and language) requirements.",
