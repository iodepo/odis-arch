schema:Thing	Thing	prov:Entity	Entity	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Action	Action	prov:Activity	Activity	skos:closeMatch	While not exact semantic matches, these classes are interchangeable in many applications.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Person	Person	prov:Agent	Agent	skos:narrowMatch	One can specify that a Person is an agent by using it as the value of the schema:agent property.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Organization	Organization	prov:Agent	Agent	skos:narrowMatch	One can specify that an Organization is an agent by using it as the value of the schema:agent property.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Thing	Thing	prov:Agent	Agent	skos:relatedMatch	Other things, aside from schema:Person or schema:Organization instances, can be prov:Agents (such as machines, AIs, etc). The semantic relation is weaker here, as schema:Things also include processual entities, which cannot be agents.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:agent	agent	prov:wasAssociatedWith	wasAssociatedWith	skos:closeMatch	In PROV, an Activity is associated with an agent, which matches the identification of a schema:agent in an Action type.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:participant	participant	prov:wasAssociatedWith	wasAssociatedWith	skos:broadMatch	schema:participant can be used to identify secondary agents in an Action	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:isBasedOn	isBasedOn	prov:wasDerivedFrom	wasDerivedFrom	skos:broadMatch	schema:isBasedOn is used for CreativeWorks, so its domain and range are narrower than prov:Entities.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:object	object	prov:wasDerivedFrom	wasDerivedFrom	skos:relatedMatch	schema.org does not have a property on schema:Thing that can directly indicate it was derived from some other instance of Thing, thus there's no 1:1 mapping to prov:wasDerivedFrom. However, by expressing what schema:Action intervened to convert one thing to another, one can use the schema:object and schema:result properties for the Action Type to express what thing (the value of object) was converted to another (the value of result).	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:result	result	prov:wasDerivedFrom	wasDerivedFrom	skos:relatedMatch	schema.org does not have a property on schema:Thing that can directly indicate it was derived from some other instance of Thing, thus there's no 1:1 mapping to prov:wasDerivedFrom. However, by expressing what schema:Action intervened to convert one thing to another, one can use the schema:object and schema:result properties for the Action Type to express what thing (the value of object) was converted to another (the value of result).	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:object	object	prov:used	used	skos:relatedMatch	schema:Action has a property 'object' which indicated what Things and Action is carried out upon. This is a fuzzy match to prov:used	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:result	result	prov:generated	generated	skos:closeMatch	schema doesn't have an inverse property for schema:result, so there's no match to wasGeneratedBy, but PROVO does provide an inverse to wasGeneratedBy, generated, which can be mapped to schema:result.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:instrument	instrument	prov:used	used	skos:closeMatch	schema:instrument can be used to describe any non-consumed Thing used in an Action, which is very similar to the PROV Activity uses Entity pattern.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:endTime	endTime	prov:endedAtTime	endedAtTime	skos:closeMatch	One has to ensure that this property is used on a schema:Action or prov:Activity.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:startTime	startTime	prov:startedAtTime	startedAtTime	skos:closeMatch	One has to ensure that this property is used on a schema:Action or prov:Activity.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:provider	provider	prov:actedOnBehalfOf	actedOnBehalfOf	skos:relatedMatch	Note that the domains of the properties in this match are different. schema:provider is a property of schema:Action, while prov:actedOnBehalfOf is a property of prov:Agent. Both can express that another agent performed an Action/Activity on behalf of another.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Person	Person	prov:Person	Person	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Organization	Organization	prov:Organization	Organization	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:SoftwareApplication	SoftwareApplication	prov:SoftwareAgent	SoftwareAgent	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable., however, the PROV class confounds function with being (software becomes an agent, and isn't always so). This is unlikely to cause issues in most applications, unless fine-grained semantic discrimination is needed.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:dateCreated	dateCreated	prov:generatedAtTime	generatedAtTime	skos:broadMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable., however, schema.org limited the domain of this property to schema:CreativeWorks, while PROV allows any prov:Entity to be a value. Surprisingly, this means that schema:Thing doesn't have a native property to describe when it came into being, although one could always add an schema:additionalProperty to express this. For representation of datasets and other creative works, these properties would be interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:dateDeleted	dateDeleted	prov:wasInvalidatedBy	wasInvalidatedBy	skos:broadMatch	The prov:wasInvalidatedBy can apply to any Entity, while the schema:dateDeleted only applies to elements in a schema:DataFeed	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:DeleteAction	DeleteAction	prov:wasInvalidatedBy	wasInvalidatedBy	skos:relatedMatch	The schema:Type, schema:DeleteAction, can be used on any schema:Thing to express its removal, which is closer to the semantics of prov:wasInvalidatedBy, with the added value that more metadata can be provided on the deletion event itself.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:startTime	startTime	prov:invalidatdAtTime	invalidatedAtTime	skos:narrowMatch	When used on a schema:DeleteAction, time properties can serve to express the time of its deletion.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:endTime	endTime	prov:invalidatdAtTime	invalidatedAtTime	skos:narrowMatch	When used on a schema:DeleteAction, time properties can serve to express the time of its deletion.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Place	Place	prov:Location	Location	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:location	location	prov:atLocation	atLocation	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Collection	Collection	prov:Collection	Collection	skos:broadMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable., however, the prov:Collection is an prov:Entity, while a schema:Collection is a schema:CreativeWork, rendering the latter semantically narrower	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:partOf	partOf	prov:hadMember	hadMember	skos:broadMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable. for datasets and other schema:CreativeWorks. Note however, that the prov:Collection is an prov:Entity, while a schema:Collection is a schema:CreativeWork, rendering the latter semantically narrower.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:isBasedOn	isBasedOn	prov:hadPrimarySource	hadPrimarySource	skos:narrowMatch	When one traverses a series of schema:CreativeWork nodes through their schema:isBasedOn properties, the primary source can be discovered. This assumes that the path is complete and intact. The PROV property is a useful shortcut and a clear assertion.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:potentialAction	potentialAction	prov:wasInfluencedBy	wasInfluencedBy	skos:relatedMatch	'Influence' is a very fluffy thing, semantically. While PROV provides a relation to express influence, in schema.org, one would have to use the schema:potentialAction property to identify one or more schema:Actions which the schema:Thing (or sub-Type thereof) was a schema:object in. Naturally, if the Thing played an object role in an Action, it was influenced by that Action and its participants. Metadata in the schema:Action type and any participant schema:Things in it can specify the nature of this influence.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:isBasedOn	isBasedOn	prov:wasQuotedFrom	wasQuotedFrom	skos:narrowMatch	When schema:isBasedOn is a property of schema:Quotation, it is semantically close to prov:wasQuotedFrom	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Quotation	Quotation	prov:Quotation	Quotation	skos:closeMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:mentions	mentions	prov:mentionOf	mentionOf	skos:broadMatch	These terms are usually interchangeable, although the domain of schema:mentions is likely narrower, being limited to schema:CreativeWork rather than prov:Entity	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:UpdateAction	UpdateAction	prov:wasRevisionOf	wasRevisionOf	skos:relatedMatch	The schema:Type, schema:UpdateAction (or its sub-Types), can be used on any schema:Thing (via schema:potentialAction) to express that it has been changed, including changes that constitute revisions. This is semantically close to prov:wasRevisionOf, with the added value that more metadata can be provided on the revision event itself.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:isBasedOn	isBasedOn	prov:wasRevisionOf	wasRevisionOf	skos:narrowMatch	While less semantically expressive than using schema:UpdateAction, schema:isBasedOn can be used to more broadly suggest change in a downstream schema:CreativeWork	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:correction	correction	prov:wasRevisionOf	wasRevisionOf	skos:relatedMatch	As some revisions can be understood as corrections, schema:correction may be a valid counterpart for prov:wasRevisionOf, with a narrower range of schema:CorrectionComment. However, as the schema:correction range is limited to schema:Comment, this is not a close mapping to a schema:CreativeWork that is a revision of another in its totality, rather a corrective note referencing it.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:Dataset	Dataset	prov:Bundle	Bundle	skos:narrowMatch	A prov:Bundle is a set of provenance statements. No close schema:Type exists, however, schema:Dataset can express the set-like nature of a systematic collection of representations, which can be representations of provenance.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:sameAs	sameAs	prov:alternateOf	alternateOf	skos:broadMatch	prov:alternateOf includes references to the same entity.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
schema:citation	citation	prov:alternateOf	alternateOf	skos:relatedMatch	prov:alternateOf includes references to different entities that represent aspects of the same prov:Entity. schema:citation allows one schema:Creative work to reference one or many others. It's likely, although not certain, that creative works in the range of schema:citation will contain information about alternate aspects of whatever the schema:CreativeWork is about. One can scan for identical values of schema:about to increase the chances that this is the case.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088
