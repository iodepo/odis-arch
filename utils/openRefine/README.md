# OpenRefine

## About

Some examples of using OpenRefine to generate a list of things.
This is done as an example for those who may have a more manual
workflow and wish to explore some tools to help automating that.

As the output from the template export in OpenRefine is an array
it give us a chance to look at both [DataFeed](https://schema.org/DataFeed)
and [ItemList](https://schema.org/ItemList).  

In the wonderfully open world of Schema.org thee is also [Series](https://schema.org/Series)
and its subtypes of [CreativeWorkSeries](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries) 
and [EventSeries](https://schema.org/EventSeries).


Since the majority of what we work with are not data sets, we will focus
on the ItemList and CreativeWorkSeries.  The comparison to RSS is
valid and casting to RSS is likely easy should it be desired.  

Note, in the context of OIH this also raises the option of leveraging 
these approaches for the publishing and indexing of resources that align
with this model.
